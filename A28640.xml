         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Abbeſſe</hi> MADAME WINEFRIDE GIFFORD, Thrice worthy Superiour of the Engliſh Monaſtery of S. <hi>Clare</hi> in Roan: And to all the vertuous

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAME,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEſides the relation of my <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi> to your whole
<hi>Community</hi> in generall, and the
<pb facs="tcp:43202:3"/> many <hi>obligations</hi> which I have to
<hi>yourſelf</hi> in particular, I had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon which determin'd my thoughts to make <hi>choice</hi> of your name and that of your <hi>Spirituall Daughters</hi> to appear in the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece</hi> of this little work. And that is: I was ever of opinion that all Books of this kind challenge it as their <hi>Birth-right</hi> to be <hi>dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> unto perſons of eminent
<hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi> for otherwiſe, it were a <hi>ſin</hi> againſt
<hi>Iuſtice,</hi> to preſent <hi>holy</hi> things unto thoſe whoſe
<hi>life</hi> is quite contrary to all the <hi>Maximes</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Perfection.</hi> This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, MADAME, it was not ſoe much a choice as a kind of neceſsity in me, to dedicate this little <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Piece unto <hi>yourſelf</hi> cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:43202:3"/> and <hi>ſecondarily</hi> unto all thoſe vertuous
<hi>Perſons</hi> who have the happines to live under your pious
<hi>Conduct.</hi> For, although <hi>vertue</hi> is practicable in all ſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, yet we muſt grant that none can be ſaid to practiſe it in a higher degree, (whatſoever the <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> of the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> dare <hi>unreaſonably</hi> murmur to the contrary) then ſuch as following the <hi>Evangelicall Counſels</hi> have willingly and joyfully abandonned all the <hi>Charms</hi> of the world, to embrace a
<hi>Monaſticall</hi> retirement and therein to conſecrate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their <hi>Lives</hi> to love, ſerve, &amp; praiſe <hi>God</hi> without ceaſe or interruption: a life which hath more of <hi>Angelicall</hi> ſolitude, then
<pb facs="tcp:43202:4"/> 
               <hi>Terreſtriall</hi> converſation. Vpon this ground, I had reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, this little Treatiſe (which hath nothing of <hi>mine</hi> but that it ſpeaks <hi>English</hi>) would not be wholly neglected by ſuch devout Souls, who willingly accept any thing that may contribute to their advancement in <hi>vertue.</hi> I had this
<hi>Intereſt</hi> alſo in it, that I durſt flatter myſelf to have given it unto thoſe who are ſoe much my <hi>friends</hi> as to be ready to pardon greater faults then ſuch as may have bine committed in this
<hi>Tranſlation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as for the <hi>Book</hi> itſelf, I hope, you will find the
<hi>matter</hi> pious and ſolid: and conſequenly worthly the reading and application <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Authour,</hi> as I am credibly informed by thoſe of his own <hi>Order,</hi> is a <hi>Perſon</hi> of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>vertue:</hi> and I should not fear to be argued of
<hi>untruth,</hi> if I should tell the <hi>World,</hi> that his late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to that <hi>eminent</hi> dignity he now holds in the <hi>Church,</hi> was more a <hi>reward</hi> of his vertue and learning, then a <hi>Gift</hi> of
<hi>fortune</hi> blindly conferred on him for his birth and friends. His
<hi>Book</hi> then not degenerating from his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and his
<hi>words</hi> not contradicted in his <hi>life,</hi> I hope you will have a double ſatisfaction in reading good Things originally delivered by ſoe good a man. I will ſay no more of my <hi>Authour,</hi> but leave you to judge of the reſt by the <hi>Book</hi> itſelf.
<pb facs="tcp:43202:5"/> Tis true, it may ſeem at firſt ſight more proper for <hi>ſecular</hi> perſons &amp; ſuch as are ſtill entangled in the occaſions and vanities of the world, then ſuch as are already withdrawn into the ſecure <hi>harbour</hi> of a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall</hi> life: It is more <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar</hi> then <hi>ſtudyed,</hi> more <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> then
<hi>ſpeculative,</hi> more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for the <hi>purgative</hi> then
<hi>unitive</hi> way. However I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, there are many
<hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> in it, which are common to all ſtates and conditions. And indeed to ſay the <hi>Truth,</hi> As I doe not love our pretended <hi>Illuminees</hi> and <hi>imaginary Saints,</hi> ſoe I doe not much affect <hi>imaginary Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; Books</hi> that will ſooner make one
<hi>mad</hi> then make one a

               <hi>Saint.</hi> Certainly, there is more profit in a little <hi>intelligible Piety,</hi> then in whole <hi>volumes of un-intelligible Raptures,</hi> and <hi>Chimericall Elevations.</hi> I like thoſe who take more care to live well, then to be eſteemed
<hi>Devotes:</hi> who take more pains to doe good <hi>Works,</hi> then to fancy high <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> who are more diligent to mortify their

<hi>helps.</hi> The way to <hi>Heaven</hi> hath alwaies bine counted very hard to find without a <hi>Guide.</hi> Wherefore I thought it worth my labour to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>One</hi> unto thee, contrived at firſt by an excellent
<hi>maſter</hi> in that <hi>Art.</hi> I know well enough that my
<hi>Verſion</hi> of it doth not approach the pithy shortnes of the <hi>Latin ſtile:</hi> and indeed, it was neither neceſſary nor convenient to render it ſoe, nay (I dare ſay) nor poſſible. If thou art no
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſt,</hi> perhaps it may ſeem tolerable: but otherwiſe, if thou goeſt to compare the <hi>English</hi> to the <hi>Latin,</hi> I shall ſoon looſe my
<pb facs="tcp:43202:7"/> cauſe. However I comfort myſelf with this
<hi>Apology</hi> for not being able to give it the ſame <hi>grace</hi> which it hath in the <hi>Originall,</hi> that it ſeems to me not only a common
<hi>fault</hi> but a neceſſary <hi>defect</hi> in all

            <p>TWo things, <hi>Gentle Reader,</hi> I muſt acquaint thee withal in the beginning of <hi>this Treatiſe.</hi> Firft, I am afraid leaſt that I should be accuſed by ſome of too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and temerity. For how, will they ſay, dareſt thou preſume to lead or direct others unto
<hi>Heaven,</hi> being thyſelf ſoe addicted and tyed to the <hi>world?</hi> Or, with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doſt thou goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe <hi>vertue</hi> unto us, being thyſelf ſoe little <hi>vertuous?</hi> Secondly, what new
<hi>Inſtructions</hi> doſt thou give us in thy <hi>Book?</hi> Thou repeateſt the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:43202:8"/> things after a rude and unpolish'd manner, which had bine written long ſince by innumerable <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours</hi> with much more
<hi>Learning,</hi> and in a more elegant <hi>ſtile:</hi> and thou art not ashamed with a proud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to expoſe the <hi>riches</hi> of others for thy own.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the words, wherewith ſome perhaps will endeavor to carp at my labour. But firſt, I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe myſelf with the
<hi>ſaying</hi> of a wiſe man, becauſe

               </q> That is: If I cannot doe well myſelf, I may at leaſt excite others to doe well,
<q>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43202:8"/>And, that I may uſe the words of another learned man:
<hi>I am not ſoe foolish, as to pretend to be able to cure others, being myſelf ſubject to the ſame infirmities: but like one that lyes ſick in the ſame Hoſpitall with others, I make bold to entertain thee with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of our common miſeries: and I communicate the remedies which I think are moſt proper to cure them. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine therefore that thou only heareſt me talking to myſelf: I am not afraid to let thee be partaker of my ſecrets in this kind.</hi> In writing theſe <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> I doe not ſoe much profeſſe myſelf a <hi>Maſter</hi> to teach others, as a
<hi>Scholler</hi> that learneth or rather teacheth himſelf by teaching others. Theſe are two things which are done <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally:</hi> for whilſt we endeavour to teach others, we teach ourſelves at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond <hi>Objection,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:43202:9"/> may be brought againſt me, I have no better
<hi>Anſwer</hi> then to confeſſe ingeniously, that here is but very little of my own <hi>invention;</hi> having borrowed moſt of the matter from other <hi>writers.</hi> I have ſet down many things, which I had partly obſerved by my own <hi>experience,</hi> &amp; which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo, in reading the holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> and antient <hi>Philoſophers</hi> I had noted as uſefull <hi>Documents</hi> for my own practiſe. But I have laboured after the example of <hi>Bees</hi> to make one good <hi>well-taſted Honey</hi> out of the mixture of ſeverall <hi>Collections:</hi> ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtill ſomething of my own to the words of my <hi>Authours.</hi> And I have endeavour'd to uſe an eaſy ſtile without any vain <hi>ornaments</hi> of flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> becauſe my deſign is to teach
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> how to <hi>doe</hi> wel, &amp; not how to
<hi>ſpeak</hi> well. Thou haſt here then a <hi>ſumme</hi> or
<hi>Compendium</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43202:9"/> of all the <hi>Morall inſtructions,</hi> which have bine ſeverally delivered by the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> for teaching us how to live well &amp; happily in this world. Thou haſt here the
<hi>Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of all the beſt <hi>morall</hi> ſayings of
<hi>Seneca, Epictetus, Antonius,</hi> and other <hi>Sages</hi> of the antient
<hi>Times.</hi> And I thought it ſufficient to ſet down thoſe wholeſome
<hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which to me had often proued <hi>efficacious Remedies</hi> in my greifs and troubles, without <hi>quoting</hi> the places from whence I had taken them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had gathered them as
<hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> Remedies for the <hi>Soul,</hi> &amp; not as points of
<hi>wit</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>fancy:</hi> my intention &amp; deſign being more to <hi>profit,</hi> then <hi>delight</hi> my <hi>Reader.</hi> A ſick man does not trouble himſelf to enquire who it was that mingled the
<hi>Phyſick</hi> which he is to take: nor is he ſollicitous to know whence
<pb facs="tcp:43202:10"/> the <hi>Remedy</hi> is brought, provided it be good &amp; cures him of his <hi>Sicknes.</hi> I have omitted many things which I could have ſaid: as alſo many things, which might have bine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd with more <hi>Subtility.</hi> I thought it better to have a few good <hi>Morall precepts,</hi> which may be alwaies ready &amp; at hand, then to ſtudy a greater number &amp; not to have them ready for <hi>uſe,</hi> when occaſion requires. He hath learnt much, who knows as much as is neceſſary for the

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. WHoſoever thou art that readeſt this
<hi>Treatiſe,</hi> know that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is, to lead thee as it were by the hand in the way to <hi>Heaven;</hi> &amp; to conduct thee unto that <hi>happy State,</hi> which once poſſeſſed will give full content to all thy deſires. This is the ſcope and aym of all mens wiſhes: &amp; unto which we all have a naturall propenſion. All men would be happy: but through
<hi>Adams</hi> fall we are all become blind, &amp; therfore the greateſt part of men forſaking the true and <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> ſpend their time very unprofitably in ſeeking after vain and tranſitory things. Some employ all their induſtry in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43202:15"/> 
                  <hi>riches;</hi> becauſe they vainly perſuade themſelves, that the cheifeſt <hi>happines</hi> of man conſiſts in wanting nothing. Others make it their cheif buſines to purchaſe <hi>Honours,</hi> &amp; bear great ſway in the world; and therfore are very ambitious to be in ſome <hi>Gouernment,</hi> or at leaſt to govern thoſe who govern. Some again deſcend ſoe low, as to ſeek and place their cheif happines in <hi>ſenſuall pleaſures;</hi> eſteeming thoſſe moſt happy who have liberty and occaſion to beſot themſelves with all manner of <hi>brutish delights.</hi> Soe little doe they value &amp; eſteem true <hi>Beatitude.</hi> And thus they all labour in vain, like men that wander in a <hi>Labyrinth;</hi> the more they purſue their
<hi>happines,</hi> the more they ſtray from it: in this moſt unhappy, becauſe they doe not underſtand their own unhappines.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the thing, Oh miſerable man, which brings thee into great diſorder &amp; miſery: Thou deſireſt to live happy, and alſo to make a happy end: but thou art wholly blind in diſcerning what true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines is, &amp; how to arrive unto it, foolishly ſtraying quite out of the right way that leads unto it. All that thou doeſt, all that thou ſayeſt, all that thou deſireſt, proues for the moſt part to be againſt thy ſelf.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43202:15"/> For thou doſt not conſider that
<hi>Soveraign</hi> &amp; <hi>infinite Good,</hi> for which thou wert crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; conſequently which ought to be the <hi>term</hi> and <hi>center</hi> of all thy deſires; but thou wandereſt here, and there, without any ſetled deſign, like <hi>Ants</hi> that run up and down the body of an old tree to little or no purpoſe. <hi>God</hi> who is the Creatour of all things hath drawn thee out of nothing, &amp; given thee a <hi>Being,</hi> to the end thou mighteſt love him with all thy hart, and ſerve him with all thy forces. As he is a neceſſary <hi>Being</hi> in himſelf, ſo alſo he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be our laſt <hi>End.</hi> Conſider then ſeriouſly, how much of thy life thou employeſt in his ſervice, unto whom thou oweſt thy ſelf wholly. All thy actions, all thy deſigns all thy counſells are vain, and to little purpoſe, if they are not directed to him. Euen as the place where thou arriveſt is called the end of thy journey, and the place where thou expecteſt to reſt: ſoe the end of thy life is terminated in
<hi>God,</hi> to whom thou oughteſt to refer all thy thoughts, words and actions; untill at laſt enjoying his ſight thou findeſt the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of all thy deſires. Whatſoever withdraws thee from
<hi>laſt End,</hi> leads thy <hi>ſoul</hi> to eternall
<hi>perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43202:16"/>3. As in a <hi>Sea-voyage,</hi> if the
<hi>ship</hi> should ſtop in ſome harbour, or caſt anchor nigh the shore to take in fresh water, thou wouldeſt perhaps buſy thyſelf in the mean time to gather up <hi>cockle-shels,</hi> or ſome pretty-shaped pibles; but yet thou wouldeſt ſtill keep an eye towards the ship, and be ſtill liſtening that way, leaſt that the <hi>Pilot</hi> should call and give ſign that all things were ready to ſet <hi>Sail:</hi> which ſign given, thou wouldeſt preſently make haſt to the <hi>ship:</hi> Soe thou art to doe in this life. Fix thy mind alwaies on <hi>God,</hi> and uſe the things of this <hi>world</hi> ſo, as not to tye thy hart unto them, nor to ſuffer them to withdraw thee from thy laſt <hi>End,</hi> which is <hi>God.</hi> All the riches and creatures of this world ſerve thee, that thou maiſt ſerve
<hi>God.</hi> The neglect of this neceſſary care of thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is the cauſe that thou permitteſt thy thougts to wander after many unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>Objects;</hi> ſo that tis true to ſay, thou adoreſt as many <hi>Idols</hi> as thou loueſt <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> with a diſordinate love. Theſe are thy <hi>Gods,</hi> unto whom thou offereſt
<hi>ſacrifice,</hi> not of an <hi>Oxe,</hi> or <hi>Buck,</hi> but thy ſelf, &amp; thy whole ſalvation. It is not permitted in the law of divine Love to love any thing elſe <hi>beſides God,</hi> unles it be in him, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43202:16"/> for him. There can be no greater miſery then to abandon the <hi>ſoveraign Good,</hi> &amp; to place our affection on
<hi>creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That which the Prince of <hi>Phiſitians</hi> ſayes of ſick bodies, the ſame may be ſaid of vicious ſouls: to wit, <hi>the more they are fed, the worſe they are.</hi> For thoſe who intend to paſſe from a bad life to a better, ought firſt to vomit up all the
<hi>Poyſon</hi> of their paſt <hi>ſins,</hi> before they begin to receive the ſolid nourishments of vertue. This purgation of thy ſoul muſt be done ſo, as not only to expiate thy paſt ſins, but alſo to extirpate all affection unto them, to root out all thy vicious habits, to maſter all thy diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered appetites and make them ſubject unto reaſon; to ſubdue thy body &amp; ſenſes, particularly that of the tongue, and to avoid all that may hinder thee from arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the ſtate of perfection. Why doſt thou fear, and imagine the way that leads to eternall Felicity, to be hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile? It lies in thy own power to make thyſelf happy, aſſiſted with his grace, who is the beginning &amp; end of all things. But thou muſt firſt goe out of thyſelf, before thou canſt come unto him: and the more thou leaveſt thyſelf, the nigher thou wilt come unto him.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43202:17"/>5. Wherefore thou shouldeſt firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with thyſelf what thou deſireſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and whither thou art going: &amp; then examine the means thou art to uſe for arriving to that happy ſtate. Which done, thou will eaſily perceive what progreſſe thou doſt make every day. Be very carefull in examining thy <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and taking a ſerious view of thyſelf, conſider what thou oughteſt to be, whilſt thou haſt time to amend. It will be too late to diſcover the deceit, when thou canſt not avoid it. Learn how to moderate the violence of thy paſſions and deſires; &amp; how to appeaſe the frights and fears of thy mind. Learn to contemn all earthly things, and willingly forſake thoſe things, which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long in thy power. Leave all things, before they leave thee; that ſoe when <hi>Death</hi> comes, it may find nothing to rob thee of. Let thy cheifeſt care be to provide for thy ſoul; for, conſidering it is firſt in dignity, it is not fit it should be the laſt in thy care. <hi>What will it avail a man to have gained the whole world, if he looſeth his ſoul in the end?</hi> we cannot eſteem it any profit, if the ſoul perisheth.</p>

<hi>Guide?</hi> who would goe about to learn any difficile <hi>Art</hi> without a <hi>Teacher?</hi> We shall find but very few who have advanced in perfection, &amp; rendered themſelves vertuous, without the help of others. It is an eaſy matter to inſtruct in generall terms thoſe who are abſent, and alſo to leave in writing for thoſe that shall come after us, what is to be done. But no man at a diſtance can tell of perſuade when and how this to be done. We muſt be preſent in time &amp; place to deliberate aright of that. A <hi>Phyſitian</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43202:18"/> can never preſcribe by letter the juſt time of taking ſome <hi>Medicine</hi> or <hi>dyet:</hi> he muſt be preſent, and feel the pulſe of the ſick perſon.

<hi>God</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the
<hi>Gentils,</hi> after he had bine converted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was ſent to <hi>Ananias,</hi> that he might learn of him the way of
<hi>Salvation.</hi> Thou haſt a hard task, to overcome the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy
<hi>Nature,</hi> to wreſtle with the euill <hi>Spirits</hi> (thy inviſible Enemyes) and to arrive to the height of <hi>Perfection</hi> amidſt ſo many obſtacles and Impediments. Wherefore thou haſt need to call for help; and that, from one who will lend thee his hand, who will shew thee the dangers, and diſcover unto thee all the Ambushes of <hi>Satan;</hi> and in fine, who will teach thee how to come of with victory in all thy ſpirituall combats. But thou wilt tell me; whom shall I call to help me? I anſwer: It muſt be a wiſe and truſty man, who shal be able and willing to doe all for thy ſpirituall <hi>Good:</hi> one that shall ſtrike reſpect and not fear into thee, when thou meeteſt him: one that is more ready to teach thee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43202:18"/> how to riſe and amend after thy fall, then to cry out againſt thee, when thou falleſt: one who gives more
<hi>Edification</hi> by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, then by his eloquent words. He is little fit to govern, who commands others to doe well, but doth no good himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chooſe ſuch a <hi>Helper</hi> or <hi>Director,</hi> who flatters no body, who doth not haunt much company, who doth not goe to great banquets, nor intrude himſelf into the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of great perſons: chooſe one, if poſſible, who hath the ſpirit of diſcretion, and can diſcern betwixt vertue and vice, betwixt good and bad, as a skillfull
<hi>Goldſmith,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth betwixt true and falſe money: who like a shilfull <hi>Phiſitian</hi> can judge of all thy ſpirituall diſeaſes, &amp; preſcribe fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to every one of them. Chooſe one that shall be free from all intereſt, and ſeeketh nothing but thy ſpirituall profit: One that shall inſtruct thee in the ſpirit of mildnes and charity, one that shall tell thee of thy faults: one that shall be able to diſcover, and teach thee how to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the ſubtileties &amp; ſtratagems of thy ſpirituall enemy the <hi>Devill:</hi> one in whom thou maiſt have a particular confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, &amp; unto whom thou maiſt have no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43202:19"/> difficulty to reveal thy moſt hidden thoughts. If thou canſt find ſuch an one, thou are happy is this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Speak frequently unto him of thy ſpirituall affairs: let him know all thy evill <hi>inclinations,</hi> all thy vicious qualities: let him know all the good thou doſt, and all the evill thou committeſt. Diſcover unto him all the particular favours thou receiveſt from
<hi>God.</hi> Deſire him that when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth in thee any irregular and diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, he will not forbear to tell thee of it; &amp; that too very often, leaſt that by being ashamed to reprehend thee, he should diſſemble at thy faults. But if it should chance that he telleth thee, he finds nothing to be reprehended in thy life, doe not preſently conclude that thou art <hi>innocent:</hi> becauſe perhaps the reaſon of his ſilence is, for that he ſees he shall get thy hatred by ſpeaking, or elſe that he deſpairs of thy amendment. Wherefore entreat him more and more, that ſoe he may ſee thou haſt a reall and earneſt deſire of advancing in
<hi>perfection.</hi> Begin to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the number of thy imperfections, &amp; reſolve to reform thy manners accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his <hi>Counſell.</hi> Rejoyce as often as he reprehendeth thee for thy faults, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43202:19"/> ſtill endeavor to come better from him, or at leaſt in a diſpoſition to grow better. It is a great matter, conſidering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon frailty of our nature, when a man is willing &amp; deſirous to amend.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe are the mutuall offices of a ſpirituall
<hi>Directour,</hi> &amp; one that deſires to learn <hi>vertue</hi> of him; that ſoe the one may grow better, and the other not looſe his labour in inſtructing him. The greateſt obſtacle in <hi>Beginners</hi> is a rebellious refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory <hi>Spirit,</hi> impatient to learn, &amp; incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being cured. For ſome that confide too much in their own wiſedome, refuſe to be governed by another. All theſe things (ſay they) which you tell me I know already. What profit is there in shewing me things which are clear enough of themſelves? and repeating the ſame things over and over? Very much; becauſe thou knoweſt many things, which thou doſt not perhaps attend unto. <hi>Admonitions</hi> are not ſo much for teaching us, as for exciting the memory, and hindring us from forgetting things. We often diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things that are clear; and therefore tis not amiſſe to inculcate the knowledge of what we already know. <hi>Vertue</hi> gathers ſtrength, when it is touched and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43202:20"/> Some are hindred and disheartned by a foolish apprehenſion or fear, which is a childish fault, and unworthy of any man. Others like <hi>frantick</hi> men keep all cloſe to themſelves, &amp; will not diſcover their infirmities to their ſpiritual
<hi>Phyſitian.</hi> The <hi>Devill</hi> perſuades them to this ſilence, hoping thereby to make his advantage of it, as long as they diſcover nothing. When thou art troubled with any corporall <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> however ſoe shamefull, thou haſt no difficulty to shew it to him that is to cure it; and yet thou hideſt with great care the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> of thy <hi>Soul,</hi> as if hiding would cure them; whereas they will at ſome time or other diſcover themſelves, in ſpight of all thy care. He that hideth his
<hi>wounds</hi> will never be cured.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Does the <hi>Phiſitian</hi> doe thee any wrong if he diſcovers thy <hi>diſeaſe:</hi> if when thou art in danger, he tells thee that thou art ill, that thou art in a <hi>feavor?</hi> that thou art to abſtain one day from meat, &amp; ordains thee to drink water in another? Sure thou wouldſt commend him, and thank him for it. But if any one should tell thee that thy <hi>paſsions</hi> or deſires are violent, that thy
<hi>opinions</hi> are vain and idle, thy <hi>affections</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, or the like; thou wouldeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43202:20"/> cry out, that thou art affronted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, &amp; abuſed; and therefore wilt be revenged of him. Unhappy man! what hurt does it doe thee to be admonished of thy <hi>Salvation?</hi> What injury canſt thou call it, unles ſuch a one, as a looking glaſſe may be ſaid to doe to an ugly face? He shews thee what thou art: Mend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy faults which he reprehends in thee, correct thy manners, wash of the ſpots of thy
<hi>Conſcience.</hi> Tis in thy power, if thou wilt, to live ſoe that no man can juſtly reprehend thee.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the purgative way; and how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate all ſins, and vicious Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The beſt motive to this, is a continuall Remembrance of Death and Eternity.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. WHenſoever any man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a <hi>Sin,</hi> he actually ſtrayeth from <hi>God;</hi> &amp; this is the cauſe of all the miſery in the world. From this proceed all the pains and troubles of this life: this is the <hi>Poyſon</hi> which infecteth the whole
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43202:21"/> world. We doe not perceive the malice of it when we commit the ſin; but when tis once committed, then we underſtand the miſcheif it brings with it. We read of <hi>Tyrants</hi> that were wont heretofore (a ſtrange punishment!) to tye living <hi>bodies</hi> unto dead
<hi>carkaſes,</hi> that ſoe they might be poyſoned to death with the horrid infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an abominable ſtench. By <hi>ſin</hi> we are brought to ſuffer the like punishment; we carry about with us our own
<hi>Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> &amp; cannot eaſily deliver ourſelves from it. If thou canſt not reſolve to ſuffer ſomething for avoiding <hi>ſin,</hi> thou wilt be forced to ſuffer much, after thou haſt committed it. An
<hi>evill action</hi> is no ſooner reſolved upon; but it preſently produceth its own <hi>punishment.</hi> Tis this which makes us guilty of
<hi>death,</hi> and eternall damnation. We muſt therefore have a ſpeciall care to expiate our conſcience from all <hi>Sin,</hi> by contrition, confeſſion, and ſatisfaction. And tis not enough to avoid falling into great ſins, but we muſt alſo have a care to avoid leſſer faults; which, although they doe not cauſe immediate death to the <hi>Soul,</hi> yet weaken our ſpirituall forces, &amp; are a diſpoſition to <hi>mortall ſin.</hi> But the <hi>ship wrack</hi> is equally the ſame, whither the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43202:21"/> 
                  <hi>ship</hi> be ſwallowed up and loſt under one great wave, or ſunk by degrees, the water entring in drop by drop. We may be more to blame for yeilding unto theſe leſſer faults, in regard the difficulty to ouercome them was leſſe. The weaker our <hi>enemy</hi> is, the greater is our shame, if we permit ourſelves to be overcome by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou wilt never be able to attain unto much
<hi>Vertue,</hi> and to reſtore thyſelf to thy former <hi>liberty,</hi> unles thou canſt firſt quit thyſelf of all affection even to the
<hi>leaſt ſins:</hi> For otherwiſe, thy body may be in the
<hi>deſert,</hi> and thy mind at the ſame time in <hi>Egipt.</hi> All does not goe well with thee, if after having pardoned injuries, and forſaken thy dishoneſt loues, thou doſt <hi>ſtill</hi> give ear to <hi>calomnies</hi> &amp; <hi>detractions</hi> againſt thy neighbors; if thou art ſtill delighted with ſome dangerous <hi>beauty.</hi> For to purchaſe an interior purity, tis not enough to extirpate all ſin out of thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> but thou muſt alſo root out all evill habits or affections, which may often remain behind after the <hi>ſin</hi> is forgiven. If thou doſt only cut the boughs &amp; leave the <hi>root</hi> entire, thou wilt ſee in a short time new <hi>branches</hi> of iniquity grow up from the ſame <hi>ſtock.</hi> Thou ſayeſt, that thou art reſolved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43202:22"/> to root out of thy ſoul all thy old
<hi>Vices.</hi> But I fear thou doſt not barr the <hi>Door</hi> againſt them, but leaveſt it ſeemingly shut, ſo as it is eaſily opened again to the ſame <hi>vices,</hi> when occaſion preſents. Thou telleſt me, that thy former life diſpleaſeth thee. I beleeve it: for who is not ashamed of himſelf, when he ſeriously conſiders the <hi>diſorders</hi> of his life paſt? Even wicked men both <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>love</hi> their own
<hi>vices,</hi> at the ſame time; nay even then when they commit them, they deteſt and abhorr them. But what avayls it to abhorr <hi>ſin</hi> in words, and not to abhor the acting and comitting of it? There is no man ſo wicked, who doth not ſome time or other loath his own <hi>ſins:</hi> but ſuch
<hi>Converts</hi> are ſoon reconciled again to their <hi>old ſins.</hi> But he that is truly converted unto <hi>God,</hi> puts the <hi>Axe</hi> to the
<hi>root,</hi> and cuts away all even to the leaſt <hi>ſprout</hi> he can find. And then living in a continuall memory and apprehenſion of his own frailty, he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoids all occaſions of <hi>ſin:</hi> &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the very ſight of any evill and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>object.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Why doſt thou alledge <hi>vain excuſes,</hi> &amp; inſiſt ſo much upon the frailty of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when <hi>God</hi> commands thee to <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43202:22"/> thy <hi>vices?</hi> who can better know the meaſure and ſtrength of thy forces, then he who gave them? why then art thou backward in obeying, when the thing does not ſo much redound to any profit in him that commands it, as it concerns thy good? oh blind and wicked rashnes? How dareſt thou be ſo <hi>bold</hi> as to reproch unto thy
<hi>maſter</hi> with a ſervile impudence, that his <hi>precepts</hi> are hard and impoſſible? as if he had deſigned to ſeek not ſo much thy
<hi>Salvation</hi> as thy punishment. Such is the perverſenes of mans nature, not only to offend <hi>God,</hi> but alſo to pretend great
<hi>difficulties</hi> in what he commands. But if thou wilt try thy own forces, thou wilt find that thou art able to doe much more, then thou thinkeſt. Tis not the difficulty of the things in themſelves that makes thee not dare to practiſe them; but becauſe thou doſt not practiſe them, the things ſeem <hi>difficile.</hi> Many things which we thought very <hi>hard</hi> to doe, become very <hi>eaſy</hi> and of no burden with a little uſe. Begin once for all, and have a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thy own force and power.
<hi>God</hi> doth not forſake his <hi>ſouldiers;</hi> &amp; he will give thee as much ſtrength as thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:43202:23"/>4. Thou wilt eaſily overcome all
<hi>vice,</hi> if thou repreſenteſt to thyſelf every day to be as the laſt of all thy life. What is it that eyes thee to this world? Beauſe thou never thinkeſt that thou art to goe ſoon out of it. Thou ſeeſt every day <hi>dead bodyes</hi> carried to the <hi>grave,</hi> which should put thee in mind that thou art alſo <hi>mortall.</hi> And yet in the midſt of all theſe <hi>dead</hi> thou thinkeſt o nothing leſſe then <hi>Death:</hi> thou ſeeſt nothing more often, &amp; yet thou forgetteſt nothing ſoe ſoon. The day will come notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that muſt carry thee alſo away; to wit when thy <hi>Soul</hi> shall be delivered out of her dark &amp; loathſom <hi>priſon</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi> Thou wilt then clearly ſee that thou haſt lived in <hi>darknes</hi> all thy life in this world. Produce, if thou canſt, amongſt ſo many years of a bad life but one day well ſpent in the exerciſe of <hi>vertue,</hi> which hath not bine defiled with ſome <hi>vice.</hi> Thy infancy is paſt away in <hi>childish bables,</hi> thy <hi>youth</hi> is ſpent in foolery and idlenes, thy <hi>riper ago</hi> in
<hi>debaucheries</hi> &amp; <hi>diſorders.</hi> Of all thoſe years which thou haſt ſpent from thy <hi>cradle</hi> untill thy <hi>old age,</hi> nothing remains but <hi>greif,</hi> and the evill fruits of <hi>iniquity.</hi> Alas! what a caſe wilt thou be in, when forced to be ashamed of what is
<hi>paſt,</hi> and afraid
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43202:23"/> of what is to come? what will thy riches avail thee in that hour, which thou haſt alwaies ſought with ſo much care and trouble? what will all thy shamefull <hi>pleaſures</hi> help thee at that time? what canſt thou then expect from all thy <hi>dignities</hi> and
<hi>honours?</hi> Oh! if it were poſſible that thou mighteſt begin again from the <hi>cradle,</hi> how carefull thou wouldſt be to lead another life: but (alas!) ſuch wishes will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeles in this hour. If thou inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to make good uſe of <hi>Time,</hi> begin from this <hi>preſent moment,</hi> &amp; reſolve from this inſtant, to forſake thoſe things, which thou wouldſt then wish to have forſaken. Tis no great matter to forſake <hi>momentary</hi> things, that thou maiſt purchaſe <hi>eternall felicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Ask any <hi>dying man</hi> what he thinks of his life paſt; and thou will ſcarce find one perhaps who hath not at that hour a quite different <hi>opinion</hi> of the riches, honours, &amp; vanities of the
<hi>world,</hi> then he had when he lived in perfect health. Then all things are weighed in a more <hi>even balance,</hi> &amp; we judge of them as they are. He that is wiſe only in the <hi>end</hi> of his life, beginneth to be wiſe very late; but thou maiſt be wiſe in good time, if thou learneſt to be ſo from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43202:24"/> the follies and examples of others. Since then it is in thy power to <hi>ſayl</hi> in preſent ſafety, why doſt thou expect a <hi>Tempeſt?</hi> Thou maiſt, if thou wilt, avoid &amp; prevent thy own <hi>miſery.</hi> Why then doſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thyſelf to future dangers? Tis a late <hi>prevention,</hi> to think to avoid
<hi>shipwrack,</hi> when thou art juſt <hi>ſinking:</hi> tis too late to uſe <hi>prudence,</hi> when thou art wholly ruined and undone. We read of many great and holy men, who after having renounced unto their own will and all they had in this <hi>world,</hi> ſpent all the remainder of their life, to learn how to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> well: &amp; yet many at their
<hi>death</hi> have confeſſed they had not yet learned that
<hi>leſſon:</hi> ſo hard it is to learn this <hi>Art.</hi> Notwithſtanding thou art ſo backward, as to defer thy <hi>Converſion</hi> untill thou art old; but tis a great <hi>folly</hi> to hope to begin then to liue well, when thou canſt live no more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Unhappy man, to what <hi>danger</hi> doſt thou expoſe thyſelf? is this thy <hi>belief,</hi> is this thy manner of living? Thy life paſſeth away like a <hi>shadow,</hi> &amp; laſteth but a
<hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thou art no ſooner <hi>born,</hi> but thou beginneſt to dye. Stop if thou canſt but one day of thy life: hinder or prolong one
<hi>hour</hi> one <hi>moment</hi> of it from flying away.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43202:24"/> But ſuch a labour would be in vain:
<hi>Time</hi> wil ſtil hurl thee away, &amp; wil never ceaſe running untill it hath brought thee and all mortall things unto their laſt generall end, to wit <hi>Death.</hi> And yet thou dareſt prefer this <hi>moment</hi> unto
<hi>Eternity,</hi> which will haue no end. Oh blindnes! oh folly! Thou are alwaies labouring to provide all that is neceſſary for thy <hi>Body,</hi> which is mortall; but as for thy <hi>Soul,</hi> which is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,</hi> thou haſt as little care to purchaſe <hi>eternall</hi> reſt and felicity for it, as if it did not at all belong unto thee. When thy <hi>body</hi> is ſick, thou art willing to undergoe any thing, to have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> cured: but thy <hi>Soul</hi> is ſick and thou wholly neglecteſt it, and doſt not feel it. Did thy
<hi>Phiſitian</hi> ever tell thee, it was neceſſary for thy health, to goe to <hi>ſee</hi> and thou refuſeſt it? didſt thou ever refuſe to take the moſt <hi>bitter medicine,</hi> when he told thee it was neceſſary? <hi>God</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth light and eaſy matters, that thou maiſt gain <hi>eternall</hi> life; and wilt thou not obey him? If thou hadſt a <hi>ſuit</hi> in <hi>law,</hi> thou wouldeſt employ all thy thoughts in it, thou wouldſt be alwaies ſpeaking of it, &amp; thou wouldſt not ceaſe to ſollicite many <hi>friends,</hi> to the end that the
<hi>Judges</hi> might be favorable to thee, and deliver their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43202:25"/> ſentence in thy behalf: and yet whereas thy <hi>eternal doom</hi> is nigh at hand, thou laugheſt, thou playeſt, and putteſt thyſelf in danger of perishing without <hi>redemption</hi> by perpetuall ſinning. Ah! forbear at laſt, grow <hi>wiſe</hi> whilſt thou haſt time, &amp; quiting thy former diſſolutions begin from this
<hi>inſtant</hi> to live ſoe as if this day were to be thy <hi>laſt.</hi> This is true <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> this is true wiſedome, to ſeparate by degrees the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Body</hi> even in this life as much as we can.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This muſt be thy conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; dayly care: in labour, in reſt, in all occaſions, <hi>ſtill</hi> endeavor to forget this <hi>world,</hi> and think of nothing but <hi>Eternity.</hi> All that enters into <hi>Eternity,</hi> remaineth fixed and immoueable: nothing can ever change it. The rich &amp; covetous <hi>Glutton</hi> after ſo many
<hi>ages</hi> is ſtill asking for a <hi>drop</hi> of water, and will be forced to ask in vain for all <hi>Eternity,</hi> Eternity is a <hi>durance</hi> which is alwaies preſent, and never to be named without horrout and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: it is a <hi>wheel</hi> that is alwaies tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: it is a
<hi>beginning</hi> that is alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, &amp; will never come to an
<hi>end.</hi> One ſerious thought of it changeth all the pleaſures of the world into bitternes, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43202:25"/> ſtriketh men into a deadly fear, leaving them quite aſtonished: it tameth all the rebellion of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and raiſeth it up from the unprofitable cares of the world to the exerciſe of
<hi>Vertue:</hi> it ſeaſoneth <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt,</hi> renders all <hi>labour</hi> eaſy, all <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſweet, all
<hi>pain</hi> delightfull, and makes it ſeem short. Suppoſe the vaſt and infinite ſpaces of the <hi>firmament</hi> were all filled with <hi>numericall figures:</hi> who but <hi>God</hi> would be able to ſumm up theſe almoſt infinite <hi>numbers?</hi> and yet this innumerable number is not the beginning of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Suppoſe ſo many <hi>years,</hi> ſo many
<hi>ages</hi> were paſſed, as are ſignifyed by thoſe figures; yet after all this, it could not be ſaid that <hi>Eternity</hi> was become ſo much the leſſe.

<hi>gluttony,</hi> that ſo he may overcome us with more eaſe, when he hath weakned our <hi>inward</hi> forces by means of this <hi>vice.</hi> Hence (from too much eating) proceeds a ſtupid, heavy, and languishing diſpoſition: hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth ſcurrilous language, too much pratling, diſſolution of
<hi>maners:</hi> hence proceedeth uncleanlines, wrangling and contention: by this our ſpirit becomes dull: and all <hi>vertue</hi> is extinguished in our

<hi>Confeſsion</hi> hide the lubricity of their <hi>youth</hi> from the
<hi>miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> chooſing rather to undergoe everlaſting <hi>torments</hi> with eternall <hi>shame</hi> after death, then here in this life to undergoe she <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi> infamy of this
<hi>vice.</hi> Adde, that thoſe

               <p n="2">2. Wherefore the firſt <hi>remedy</hi> againſt this

Woe be unto thee, if thou once beginneſt to deliberate the leaſt in ſuch <hi>temptations.</hi> That <hi>caſtle</hi> is nigh ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, whoſe <hi>Governour</hi> once begins to <hi>parley</hi> with the <hi>Enemy.</hi> That thou maiſt avoid all

Even thoſe that are juſt are not wholly free from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this <hi>ſin:</hi> they may alſo have ſome hidden <hi>reliques</hi> of it; ſome ſecret <hi>hiſsings</hi> of the old <hi>Serpent;</hi> as for example, certain little <hi>affections</hi> which although they are

               <p n="3">3. Take heed above all things, thou art not deceived by too much <hi>confidence</hi> in thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He that fears nothing is half fallen. How many great and learned men, after having obtained great

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43202:30"/> thyſelf in danger by preſuming too much on thy own <hi>forces.</hi> Yet ſuch is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary credulity of human
<hi>obſtinacy,</hi> that we never believe others to have fallen, untill we alſo fall ourſelves. <hi>Woman</hi> was created to help <hi>man,</hi> but by the malice of the <hi>devill</hi> she is become his greateſt
<hi>enemy.</hi> There is nothing in a <hi>woman</hi> which doth not wound, burn, and kill. No <hi>Hyena</hi> to be compared to her <hi>voice:</hi> no
<hi>Baſilisk</hi> to be compared to her <hi>eyes.</hi> Ah! whoever thou art then, if thou deſireſt to ſave thy <hi>Soul,</hi> fly as much as thou canſt the ſight and converſation of <hi>women.</hi> They ſtill keep their ancient and firſt cuſtome, which is, to be the occaſion of
<hi>banishing</hi> man out of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Many <hi>excuſes</hi> are commonly alledged in this buſines: Many pretenſes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, cuſtome, and a good intention. Notwithſtanding all this, great miſcheifs often lye hid under the
<hi>colour</hi> of good. Hence proceed dangerous familiarities, indiſcreet &amp; over-free diſcourſes, light ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, a neglect of
<hi>modeſty,</hi> frequent letters and preſents from one to another, and a certain <hi>mirth</hi> which by little and little overcometh all
<hi>shame,</hi> untill at length all <hi>modeſty</hi> is loſt. Theſe things are practiſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43202:30"/> by degrees: and he that at firſt did uſe to <hi>blush</hi> at the ſight and approach of a <hi>woman</hi> now is not afraid to behold <hi>wanton</hi> looks and a <hi>naked</hi> breaſt; which ſtriking into his hart a ſweet and ſecret <hi>poyſon,</hi> he is undone before he perceives his own <hi>danger.</hi> Thus the <hi>eye</hi> of our reaſon firſt becomes <hi>dim,</hi> &amp; at laſt is ſtruck quite
<hi>blind.</hi> Thus a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Soul</hi> which was born for
<hi>heaven</hi> is tyed to the world, forgetting both <hi>God</hi> &amp; herſelf; untill at length the flames of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence</hi> deliver her up to <hi>eternall</hi> flames. Oh miſerable men! whoſe impure &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany <hi>pleaſures</hi> muſt have ſuch a ſad end. One would think they had all eaten of the <hi>Sardonian hearb:</hi> ſince they <hi>laugh</hi> at the ſame time that they are <hi>dying.</hi>

Ruminate well on this point, and if thou beleeveſt it, tremble with fear and apprehenſion. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and joyes of this world are paſt in a <hi>moment;</hi> but the <hi>torments</hi> which follow, will laſt for all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But if thou ſeekeſt <hi>pleaſure</hi> in this life, why doſt thou not chooſe true, ſolid, honeſt, immutable
<hi>pleaſure,</hi> ſuch as is found in a <hi>quiet</hi> mind, that ſo thou maiſt delight in ſomething within thyſelf? <hi>Senſuall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> is alwaies falſe, effeminate, frayl, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by wines and parfumes; and ſtill fears to be diſcovered. Its ordinary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43202:31"/> is publick ſtews, taverns, and ſuch like places, which apprehend nothing more then the <hi>Officers</hi> of
<hi>Iuſtice.</hi> Though it may have a ſeeming outward grace, yet in reality it is a miſerable <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> It is gone in a moment, no ſooner begun but it perisheth. But the pleaſure of the mind is a noble, peaceable, invincible, ſecure and laſting content: never cloyeth, nor brings repentance. It is not accompanied with <hi>shame,</hi> nor followed with
<hi>ſorrow;</hi> and it never forſakes thoſe that enjoy it. If thou deſireſt to enjoy this, thou muſt firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all <hi>ſenſuall pleaſures.</hi> The greateſt and trueſt <hi>pleaſure</hi> is to contemn all <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Hear, thou miſerable man, who art ſtill tormented with inſatiable <hi>Avarice.</hi> Although thou haſt man ſumptuous
<hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> although thou poſſeſſeſt infinite
<hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> and heaps of <hi>mony,</hi> although the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thy
<hi>Poſſeſsions</hi> reacheth to forreign <hi>Countreyes:</hi> yet the day will come decreed from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> wherein thou muſt leave all this, and thy life too, with a bitter &amp; unwilling <hi>hart.</hi> All theſe things will perish and vanish away: and <hi>God</hi> ſend thou doſt not perish too, for having <hi>loved</hi> them too much. Then shalt thou underſtand, how contemptible thoſe things were which now thou admireſt, having rendred thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like unto thoſe <hi>children,</hi> who make great eſteem of meer <hi>bables.</hi> They are much delighted with little
<hi>pibbles,</hi> and painted <hi>ſtones</hi> which they find upon the
<hi>shore;</hi> and thou art ready to run mad for a little heap of <hi>yellow earth,</hi> and a few glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>ſtones:</hi> and this thy
<hi>folly</hi> may coſt thee very dear in the end. Tis not that I forbid thee to poſſeſſe <hi>riches,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> hath
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43202:34"/> made thee <hi>rich:</hi> but I could wish thou hadſt no ill gotten <hi>wealth,</hi> nothing <hi>purchaſed</hi> unjuſtly, by ſordid gain, and too much care and ſollicitude. Receive thy
<hi>riches</hi> into thy <hi>coffers,</hi> but take heed of hoarding them up in thy mind: but be alwaies ready to part with them whenſoever it shall pleaſe
<hi>God</hi> to take them away. No man is truly <hi>rich,</hi> but he that thinks he doth not want <hi>riches.</hi> Doe not ſtay untill <hi>Theeves</hi> or chance shall rob thee of what thou poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt: prevent them in time, and take away from thyſelf (by bearing a mind <hi>indifferent</hi> towards all theſe outward things) all that others can <hi>robb</hi> thee of. Thou wilt then be <hi>maſter</hi> of thyſelf, when thy <hi>riches</hi> doe not maſter thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Learn to renounce all pompe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in thy manner of living: and live not ſo much according to the <hi>example</hi> of others as according to the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>modell</hi> which hath bine left us by
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Poverty with the help of <hi>frugality</hi> may be changed into <hi>riches.</hi> Nature deſires but little; that is, to have juſt <hi>proviſion</hi> enough againſt hunger, thirſt and cold: and no more. What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but that thou maiſt have a <hi>houſe</hi> good enough without having it built of <hi>marble:</hi> and be cloathed well &amp; decently enough
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43202:34"/> without having thy <hi>apparell</hi> made of the richeſt <hi>ſilks.</hi> Canſt thou not quench thy <hi>thirſt,</hi> unles thou drinkeſt in a <hi>cryſtall cup,</hi> that ſo thou maiſt drink and fear at the ſame time? Canſt thou not cut thy <hi>bread</hi> without having the <hi>haft</hi> of thy knife made of <hi>Ivory,</hi> and beſet with <hi>pearls?</hi> muſt thou needs have a <hi>baſon</hi> of
<hi>ſilver</hi> to wash thy hands in, whereas an <hi>earthen</hi> one would ſerve as well? will not a <hi>lantorn</hi> give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient light unles the work of it be all <hi>gilded?</hi> He is a ſlave to his <hi>gold,</hi> who thinks his <hi>gold</hi> can any way adorn him. How mucn better would it be to love true <hi>riches;</hi> to wit, ſuch as make a man better, ſuch as no
<hi>fortune</hi> nor <hi>death</hi> itſelf can take away from us? why art thou afraid of <hi>poverty</hi> ſince thou haſt a <hi>kingdome</hi> in thy own breaſt? The <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is within thee. Let it not be ſaid then that thou ſeekeſt any other <hi>riches.</hi> Seek the true and <hi>ſoveraign Good,</hi> which is nothing elſe but <hi>God</hi> himſelf. In him is thy poſſeſſion and kingdome. For in him is all
<hi>good,</hi> and all <hi>riches.</hi> Unto whom <hi>God</hi> is all things, this <hi>world</hi> ſeems as nothing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All that shineth, all that ſeemeth great in this
<hi>world,</hi> is but pure <hi>Vanity,</hi> a meer nothing. What doſt thou wonder at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43202:35"/> to ſee a man richly clad in
<hi>purple,</hi> loaden with <hi>gold,</hi> and followed by a great train of
<hi>ſervants?</hi> All this is but <hi>pompe.</hi> They are things which are shewn, but not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and they paſſe away at the ſame time that they pleaſe. This is a <hi>truth</hi> which is learnt not ſoe much in the <hi>ſchools</hi> of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> not ſo much from the
<hi>croſſe</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or from the <hi>eternall</hi> wiſedome of <hi>God;</hi> as from the <hi>world</hi> it ſelf, and thoſe who are enslaved in the <hi>vanities</hi> of it. Doe but hear how
<hi>Aman,</hi> the moſt rich, the moſt powerfull, the moſt favoured of his <hi>Prince</hi> amongſt all the men of his time: doe but hear how he ſpeakes unto his <hi>friends,</hi> having aſſembled them together. <hi>I eſteem</hi> (ſays he) <hi>all that I poſſeſſe as nothing as long as I am forced to ſee Mardocheus ſitting before the Kings door</hi> Oh folly! oh blindnes! I have often read and heard, that all the things of this

Wherefore unles thou canſt contemn the things of this <hi>world,</hi> thou doſt nothing. Begin then to contemn ſomething in thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43202:35"/> and contemn it becauſe it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing It concerns thee to bridle thy <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſnes;</hi> that ſo thou maiſt accuſtome thyſelf to the love of <hi>poverty,</hi> and learn to eſteem things in as much as thou haſt need of them. Thou wilt eaſily contemn all things, if thou doſt accuſtome thyſelf to think alwaies of

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. NO <hi>Anger</hi> is juſt and lawfull, unles it be when we are angry againſt <hi>Anger</hi> itſelf. It is a cruell
<hi>monſter,</hi> an outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and turbulent <hi>paſsion,</hi> which if once it gets the <hi>upper hand</hi> in a mans hart, it ſcarce leaves any ſign or figure of man in him. <hi>Anger</hi> is a short <hi>madnes,</hi> and makes a man out of himſelf; thirſting after arms, blood, and ſlaughter: forgetting all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, civility, and friendship: ſnatching at any weapon or occaſion to doe others <hi>miſcheif;</hi> like unto ſome great
<hi>Ruine</hi> which breaks itſelf into many <hi>pieces</hi> upon that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43202:36"/> which it overwhelmeth. Nothing is more hideous to behold then an <hi>angry</hi> man: his <hi>eyes</hi> ſeem to burn and ſparkle with <hi>rage,</hi> his <hi>veins</hi> ſwell, his <hi>hair</hi> ſtands upright, his <hi>lips</hi> tremble, his <hi>teeth</hi> chatter, his
<hi>mouth</hi> foams, his <hi>voice</hi> breaks forth with a harsh and raging
<hi>Tone.</hi> No <hi>paſsion</hi> puts a man into ſuch
<hi>diſorder.</hi> It renders the <hi>face</hi> dreadfull, contracteth the
<hi>forehead,</hi> makes the <hi>head</hi> shake, the <hi>feet</hi> ſtumble, the <hi>hands</hi> tremble, and the whole <hi>body</hi> is put into ſtrange motions. Adde his threatning <hi>geſtures,</hi> the clapping of his
<hi>hands,</hi> his ſtriking the ground with his <hi>feet,</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his
<hi>breſt,</hi> pulling his <hi>hair,</hi> tearing his <hi>garments,</hi> &amp; his <hi>blood</hi> riſing in every part. Now gueſſe in what condition his <hi>mind</hi> is within, ſince his outward <hi>motions</hi> are ſo extravagant. As the <hi>Poets</hi> deſcribe the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall monſters</hi> all in <hi>flames,</hi> environed with <hi>ſerpents,</hi> and howling with a moſt hideous <hi>noiſe;</hi> ſuch is the <hi>picture</hi> of an angry man, when he is in his bloody <hi>fury,</hi> and rageth with a brutish <hi>cruelty.</hi> Other <hi>vices</hi> may be hidden or diſguiſed:
<hi>Anger</hi> alwaies diſcovers it ſelf, appears in the <hi>face,</hi> and like <hi>fire</hi> catcheth and layes hold of all things: and the more thou ſtriveſt to hide it, the more it rageth. He that is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43202:36"/> tranſported with <hi>anger,</hi> ſeems uncapable of all <hi>moderation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Other <hi>vices</hi> have their certain limits, but
<hi>Anger</hi> is boundles, and reacheth all things: we are <hi>angry</hi> ſometimes againſt <hi>heaven</hi> itſelf. Hence proceed ſoe many
<hi>blasphemies,</hi> ſoe many <hi>murmurings</hi> againſt <hi>God;</hi> hence it is that the wicked and <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> raiſe ſo many
<hi>queſtions</hi> and <hi>diſputes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his divine
<hi>providence.</hi> And we are not only <hi>angry</hi> with thoſe, whom we think to have already wronged us, but we are alſo troubled with the thought of future <hi>injuries;</hi> ſo that if we apprehend (though perhaps it is but our <hi>fancy</hi>) that ſuch a <hi>party</hi> will doe us wrong, we are moved to be <hi>angry</hi> with him, as much as if he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done it: ſoe apt is our <hi>nature</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent new matter of <hi>ſin.</hi> It happens alſo very often, that we are <hi>angry,</hi> and yet we know not with whom: and if we meet with no body elſe to exerciſe our <hi>rage</hi> upon, we are <hi>angry</hi> with ourſelves. But that thou maiſt know, that this
<hi>paſsion</hi> is not alwaies occaſioned by <hi>injuries,</hi> we are
<hi>angry</hi> ſometimes with things, which can no way offend us, much les doe us any <hi>wrong.</hi> Soe, many times, we tear our <hi>garments,</hi> throw down our <hi>plate,</hi> break
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43202:37"/> our <hi>quils,</hi> tear our <hi>paper,</hi> when we doe not find them proper to our uſe. Soe many times, we fall into paſſion for a <hi>cup</hi> thrown down, for our <hi>table</hi> not well covered, for our <hi>ſervant</hi> not making haſt enough, for a
<hi>ſtool</hi> or <hi>chair</hi> moved with noiſe; and many ſuch little things, which can neither deſerve nor feel our <hi>anger.</hi> Soe, ſometimes a ſtubborn and headſtrong <hi>horſe,</hi> a barking
<hi>dog,</hi> the noiſe of <hi>birds,</hi> the importunity of <hi>flies,</hi> or the biting of <hi>fleas</hi> rouſe up our <hi>anger,</hi> and make us
<hi>impatient.</hi> Conſider thy own folly, in revenging thyſelf upon
<hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures</hi> and things without life, whereas it were more fit thoſe things should be permitted to punish and correct thy
<hi>folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If we look upon the dammage and evill effects of
<hi>Anger,</hi> there is no <hi>plague</hi> imaginable that hath done more miſcheif to <hi>human-kind.</hi> We shall find that all the murders, ſlaughter, deſtruction of <hi>Towns</hi> and whole <hi>Countreyes</hi> have bine all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by this We shall find that <hi>anger</hi> hath bine the cauſe of all thoſe great heaps of <hi>dead</hi> bodyes, and rivers coloured with <hi>blood.</hi> Behold the ruines of many noble <hi>cityes;</hi> Anger pulled them down, and hath laid ſome of them ſoe deſolate that tis
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43202:37"/> ſcarce known where they ſtood. Behold vaſt <hi>deſerts</hi> not inhabited by men; <hi>Anger</hi> hath depopulated them. Behold ſo many houſes conſumed with <hi>fire,</hi> ſo many
<hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> malitiouſly poyſoned, ſo many <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> quite extinguished: <hi>Anger</hi> hath bine the cauſe of all theſe
<hi>miſcheifs.</hi> A man might term the world a ſociety of
<hi>beaſts</hi> rather then of <hi>men,</hi> were it not that
<hi>beaſts</hi> agree amongſt themſelves, whilſt men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tearing in pieces one another. Adde, that the paſſion of <hi>Anger</hi> makes a man looſe the likenes of <hi>God,</hi> whoſe works are alwaies full of <hi>peace:</hi> it blindeth our mind ſo as we cannot ſee the
<hi>truth,</hi> nor follow the advice of <hi>friends:</hi> it troubles and perverts all the faculties of our <hi>Soul,</hi> and yet whilſt it diſcompoſeth the whole man, we ſcarce beleeve there is any thing in it unbeſeeming a man: ſuch is the common opinion of the <hi>world,</hi> that they think it a brave thing to be <hi>angry.</hi> But it is now time to ſpeak of the <hi>remedies</hi> whereby this inordinate <hi>paſsion,</hi> if it cannot be quite extinguished, may at laſt be made ſubject unto reaſon, and brought to a kind of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Above all things the beſt <hi>remedy</hi> is, preſently to contemn the firſt provocation
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43202:38"/> to <hi>anger,</hi> and to reſiſt it in the beginning: For if it once begin to carry us out of the right way of
<hi>vertue,</hi> it will be a hard matter to return again into it. It will then doe what it pleaſeth, and not what thou haſt a mind to <hi>permit.</hi> When an <hi>Enemy</hi> is once entred within the gates of a <hi>Town,</hi> he doth not ſtand to capitulate with his <hi>Captives.</hi> For it is much eaſier not to admit &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto what is bad, then to moderate it when once admitted. The <hi>upper regions</hi> of the <hi>ayr</hi> which are nigheſt to the <hi>ſtars</hi> are neither darkned with <hi>clouds,</hi> nor troubled with <hi>tempeſts,</hi> but free from all <hi>tumult:</hi> tis the
<hi>lower regions</hi> that are ſubject to <hi>thunders.</hi> Even ſoe a high and <hi>generous</hi> mind, being alwaies in a <hi>quiet ſtation,</hi> is above all thoſe things which occaſion <hi>anger,</hi> refraineth all paſſionate motions, and gives little liberty to his <hi>tongue:</hi> for he knows that <hi>anger</hi> doth not take away the evill, but makes it greater. As <hi>birds,</hi> thinking to shake of the <hi>brid-lime,</hi> which hath touched them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle all their <hi>feathers</hi> in it: ſo all
<hi>impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> doth but augment our torment. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> doth us more hurt then the <hi>injury</hi> He that is <hi>angry,</hi> thinks he is contemned by another; but he that hath a right eſteem of himſelf doth not ſeek
<hi>revenge,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43202:38"/> he is inſenſible to <hi>injuries.</hi> To ſeek revenge is to confeſſe our grief and ſufferance. Tis no ſign of a <hi>generous</hi> mind, to ſeek to bite one that hath bite us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When thou heareſt any one ſpeak ill of thee, preſently think not what he ſayes, but what thou art to <hi>anſwer</hi> according to <hi>vertue.</hi> Let not the <hi>malice</hi> of another have ſo much power over thee, as to diſturb thy <hi>inward</hi> peace. <hi>God,</hi> who is all powerfull, ſuffereth ſo many wicked men: and thou who art worſe then all the reſt canſt not bear with one. Tis a foolish thing not to correct thy own <hi>malice,</hi> which is in thy power, &amp; yet to think to correct the <hi>malice</hi> of others, which is not in thy power. If thou art guilty of ſo many <hi>ſins,</hi> whatſoever thou ſuffereſt is nothing in compariſon to <hi>hell</hi> which thou deſerveſt. Who art thou, that nothing muſt be ſaid to offend thy <hi>ears?</hi> he that doth an <hi>injury</hi> to another of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himſelf, becauſe he
<hi>ſinneth.</hi> But what is it that hath hapned unto thee? Even that which
<hi>God</hi> had decreed from all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> for the good of thy
<hi>Soul.</hi> Hear what <hi>God</hi> ſayes to thee. <hi>If you forgive others I will alſo forgive you.</hi> If this <hi>word</hi> doth not awake thee, thou doſt not ſleep, but art dead. Thou muſt forgive others, to obtain
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43202:39"/> 
                  <hi>pardon</hi> for thy own
<hi>faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. We muſt endeavor to put all <hi>ſuſpitions</hi> out of our mind: they are often the cauſe of much <hi>anger.</hi> Such a man did not ſalute me civilly, another broke of his diſcourſe with me abruptly, a third did not look well upon me. Thus we ſeldome want ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, reaſons and conjectures for <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,</hi> being alwaies too credulous to evill. Commonly the greateſt part of the <hi>injury</hi> proceeds from our miſconſtring of things. Wherefore <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> and a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable interpretation of all things is very neceſſary. Plead the cauſe of the abſent party againſt thyſelf, and ever ſuſpect that
<hi>paſsion,</hi> which makes thee ſtill apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, what thou art afraid to hear; and which puts thee into <hi>anger,</hi> before thou haſt time to judge of the matter. We muſt alwaies take time; for truth is ſeldome otherwiſe diſcovered. If thou wert to <hi>judge</hi> ſome ſmall mony-buſines, thou wouldſt determine nothing in the caſe without
<hi>witneſſes;</hi> and yet thou haſt no ſcruple to condemn thy
<hi>friend,</hi> without hearing him ſpeak. Tis not the part of a
<hi>wiſe</hi> man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to give credit to every <hi>report.</hi> Many tell <hi>untruths,</hi> with intention to deceive: many again, becauſe they have bine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43202:39"/> themſelves by ſuch <hi>reports.</hi> He that ſayes a thing in ſecret, does in a manner not ſpeak it. But what is more injuſt, then to believe in <hi>ſecret,</hi> and to be angry in
<hi>publick?</hi> In fine, it is good not to ſee all, and not to hear all things. For he cannot be ſaid to have ſuffered any <hi>wrong,</hi> who is ignorant of the <hi>injury</hi> done him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When thou knoweſt that others ſpeak ill of thee, ask thy own <hi>conſcience</hi> if thou haſt never ſpoken ill of them. Then think with thyſelf, of how many ſeverall perſons thou dayly ſpeakeſt. By this means, if thou often conſulteſt thy own
<hi>conſcience,</hi> thou wilt be more moderate in regard of thy neighbour. For how canſt thou exclaim ſo much againſt the <hi>debauchery</hi> of others, ſince thou haſt ſpent thy <hi>youth</hi> in the ſame diſorders. Why art thou ſo ſubject to blame others for lying, being thyſelf guilty of <hi>perjury?</hi> why doſt thou rayl ſo much againſt the <hi>perfidiouſnes</hi> of men, ſince thou thyſelf haſt ſo often broken thy word and deceived others? why art thou ſo forward to
<hi>correct</hi> others, and yet canſt not endure to be <hi>corrected</hi> thyſelf. Think with thyſelf not only what thou <hi>ſuffereſt,</hi> but alſo what thou haſt given others to <hi>ſuffer.</hi> All that thou reprehendeſt in others, thou wilt find
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43202:40"/> the ſame in thy own <hi>breſt.</hi> We are all bad enough, and therefore we muſt pardon thoſe <hi>faults</hi> which are common to all. And though thou haſt not as yet committed the ſame
<hi>fault,</hi> yet thou maiſt doe it hereafter. <hi>He that ſtands, let him take heed he doth not fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. What wonder is it, that an <hi>enemy</hi> should doe thee hurt, that a <hi>friend</hi> should give thee offence, that thy
<hi>children</hi> doe amiſſe, that thy <hi>ſervants</hi> commit a fault? Theſe things are alwaies as common in the world, as <hi>roſes</hi> in the ſpring, as <hi>fruits</hi> in ſummer. As it is impoſſible for a man to walk up and down a great <hi>Town,</hi> and not to get a fall ſometimes, to be ſtopped, to be ſpotted with dirt; ſoe many troubles, many wranglings, many impediments often occurr in the various courſe of a mans life. Why doſt thou wonder then &amp; art troubled to ſee a wicked man doe thee an
<hi>injury?</hi> It is but what was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him. But if thou art good thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, doe alwaies good unto thy neighbour, and ſtrive to make others alſo good by thy example. Tis not thy <hi>revenge,</hi> but thy
<hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> and good <hi>deeds</hi> that muſt make them ſoe: at leaſt by this means, if thou canſt not make them <hi>good,</hi> thou will make them
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43202:40"/> 
                  <hi>Courteous,</hi> and civill: if thou canſt effect neither, yet without doubt thou wilt make thyſelf much better by it. Such a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſpeaks ill of thee, and is much incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt thee. Wilt thou know what thou art to doe in this caſe? Say to thyſelf: I cannot believe it. If he hath ſaid any hurt of me, he did it by miſtake, his <hi>zeal</hi> was good, and his intention not bad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps: either he ſaid it for my <hi>good,</hi> or I have given him ſome
<hi>occaſion</hi> to ſpeak ſo of me We cannot properly call it an
<hi>injury,</hi> when we only ſuffer what we have done unto others. I am truly guilty of ſuch a <hi>fault,</hi> and tis but juſt I ſhould be
<hi>taxed</hi> with it. But perhaps I ſuffer unjuſtly, and am blamed without reaſon. What then? I will imitate my Sauiour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and I will ſay with the <hi>Royall Prophet: I was dumb, and did not open my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> The evill <hi>words</hi> &amp; evill <hi>deeds</hi> of others; although they are bad in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will doe thee no harm, unles thou makeſt bad uſe of them They are good or bad in our regard, according to the uſe we make of them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all offenſe?
<hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Take away the <hi>opinion</hi> of harm; that is, doe not think thyſelf hurt, &amp; nothing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43202:41"/> will hurt thee. There is nothing which can touch, reach, or enter into thy <hi>mind:</hi> nothing can move it but thy own
<hi>judgment:</hi> it is that which makes things ſeem
<hi>inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable</hi> when they happen. Nothing can hurt thee, unles thou hurteſt thyſelf. But thou wilt ſay perhaps, he is a <hi>wicked</hi> man that perſecutes me. Stay a little and he will ſuffer that
<hi>punishment</hi> from others, which he hath deſerved from thee; and he hath already begun his own <hi>punishment,</hi> becauſe he hath ſinned. But he hath wit and knowledge enough; why then doth he not mend his
<hi>faults?</hi> True: and thou who doſt not want the light of
<hi>reaſon,</hi> why doſt thou not correct thy <hi>impatience?</hi> The ſins of others are ſtill before thy eyes, but thou canſt not ſee thy own <hi>imperfections.</hi> But hear me a little, whoſoever thou art, who delighteſt in <hi>revenge;</hi> I will ſuppoſe that <hi>God</hi> had given thee free power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſin; but with this condition, that thou art to begin with punishing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>offenders.</hi> Let the injuries be punished in order.

<hi>Plato</hi> being once angry with his <hi>ſervant,</hi> and having lifted up his hand to ſtrike him, ſtopped ſaying: <hi>I would ſtrike thee, if I were not angry.</hi> Thus he thought it better to punish his own

They are like <hi>ſick</hi> perſons, who are alwaies <hi>intemperate,</hi> and cannot be ruled, and therefore we muſt pardon them. We revenge ourſelves ſufficiently upon one that ſpeaks ill of us, by ſeeking no <hi>revenge</hi> at all. Thy
<hi>enemies</hi> intention is to make thee grieve and ſuffer; But if thou takeſt it patiently and grieveſt not, the <hi>greif</hi> and ſuffering will fall upon him, when he ſees he hath bine fruſtrated of his hope to ſee thee ſuffer by his <hi>contumelies:</hi> Soe that the fruit (as we may ſay) of an <hi>injury</hi> depends on the feeling and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of him that ſuffers it. When thou sheweſt thyſelf <hi>angry</hi> againſt injurious words, thou ſeemeſt to own them; but if thou neglecteſt &amp; contemneſt them, they will vanish away of themſelves. But thou wilt ſay perhaps, it is a great diſgrace to be contemned, and not to ſeek to defend our <hi>honour.</hi> Say rather, it is a shamefull thing to be afraid of contempt; for he that feareth this, commonly deſerves to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43202:42"/> be contemned A <hi>wiſe</hi> man doth not regard what the <hi>world</hi> eſteems a diſgrace: nothing in his opinion can bring diſgrace, but <hi>Sin.</hi> If ſuch a perſon contemns me, let him look to it: as for my part, I shall take care not to doe or ſay any thing which may deſerve <hi>contempt.</hi> Doth he hate me? let him look to that alſo. As for my part, I shall endeavor to carry myſelf peaceably and lovingly towards all. Thus the <hi>invincible</hi> patience of a
<hi>vertuous</hi> man wearyes and triumphs over the <hi>malice</hi> of the wicked; and in this he imitates <hi>God,</hi> who pardoneth all things, endureth all things and ſtill ſurpaſſeth our <hi>wickednes</hi> with his continuall <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</hi> Tis a more generous action, not to take notice of an <hi>injury,</hi> then to pardon it.</p>

<hi>Hangman,</hi> firſt rageth againſt <hi>itſelf,</hi> before it attacketh the proſperity of <hi>others.</hi> The punishment of other
<hi>vices</hi> commonly follows them, but the punishment of <hi>Envy</hi> ſeems to goe before it. For the <hi>envious</hi> man makes his own
<hi>torment</hi> of the felicity of others, and waxeth <hi>lean</hi> by ſeeing his <hi>neighbour</hi> in a good caſe. He that is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this <hi>vice,</hi> ſinneth and is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time. Other
<hi>vices</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſome particular <hi>vertue,</hi> but this is an enemy to all that is good, and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the whole order of
<hi>nature.</hi> It is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto the divine <hi>Goodnes,</hi> whoſe nature it is to communicate all its <hi>perfections:</hi> it is oppoſite to the ſtate of the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in heaven, who rejoyce at the
<hi>felicity</hi> of others as much as for their own: it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto
<hi>Chriſtian charity,</hi> which rejoyceth for the proſperity of her
<hi>enemies:</hi> it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43202:43"/> in fine to the <hi>law</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> which commandeth us to wish the ſame <hi>proſperity</hi> unto others as to ourſelves. As the <hi>Eye</hi> which is infected with a certain <hi>inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which Phiſitians call <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> cannot endure the ſight of any thing that shines; ſoe the <hi>envious</hi> man is tormented with beholding the <hi>vertue</hi> and credit of others.
<hi>Envy</hi> is called in Latin <hi>Invidia,</hi> becauſe it ſeeth too much the happines of others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>devills</hi> envy men, but doe not
<hi>enuy</hi> one another: and yet thou who art a <hi>man,</hi> envieſt other
<hi>men,</hi> in which thou art worſe then a <hi>Devill.</hi> Tis a ſign of a <hi>weak</hi> mind, and that thou condemneſt thyſelf in thy own
<hi>judgment:</hi> for thou wouldeſt never <hi>envy</hi> others, unles thou didſt think them better then thyſelf, and above thee in ſome things. Doſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to give way to this <hi>paſsion?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn all the fading and inconſtant things of this <hi>world,</hi> and fixe thy love on
<hi>eternall</hi> riches. The love of <hi>Eternity</hi> killeth all envy. He that aſpires unto <hi>eternall</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, cannot envy others for enjoying <hi>temporall</hi> felicity. What <hi>Prince</hi> did ever envy the low condition of ſome <hi>mechanick Artiſt?</hi> A mind that is employed in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43202:44"/> contemplation of <hi>higher</hi> things, cannot deſcend unto theſe <hi>vile</hi> offices. Is it not enough to be troubled with our own <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,</hi> which are very many, but we muſt alſo torment ourſelves by <hi>envying</hi> the good of others? Thou wilt never be <hi>happy,</hi> as long as thou enuyeſt thoſe that are
<hi>happier</hi> then thyſelf. Doſt thou think, that that <hi>felicity</hi> which thou <hi>enuyeſt,</hi> in others, can be taken away from them and conferred upon thee? I will ſuppoſe thy <hi>neighbour</hi> is rich, learned, and placed in ſome eminent <hi>dignity:</hi> Thou maiſt make all theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages thine, by <hi>loving</hi> him. He that loveth to
<hi>ſee</hi> others happy, is happy himſelf: he that loveth to
<hi>ſee</hi> others rich, is rich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I joyn <hi>Sloth</hi> unto <hi>Envy,</hi> becauſe they are both a kind of <hi>Sadnes:</hi> the one is <hi>Sad</hi> for anothers good, the other for his own. Both are found in <hi>weak-minded</hi> perſons: for as the <hi>ſcripture</hi> ſayes: <hi>Envy killeth the little one:</hi> and <hi>ſloth</hi> is the vice of a drooping mind, which is weary with the labour of <hi>ſpirituall</hi> exerciſes; and being frightned with the greatnes and difficulty of them cannot reſolve to undertake any thing worthy of a man. The <hi>ſluggard</hi> will and will not: he is ever various and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43202:44"/> a burden to himſelf, troubleſome to others, and by his continuall weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomenes working his own <hi>torment.</hi> He is like unto a <hi>Top</hi> that children play withal, which turneth round, but doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; &amp; though it is in continuall <hi>motion</hi> by force of the <hi>laſh</hi> wich keeps it up, yet for al this it may be ſaid to ſtand ſtil in the ſame place. The <hi>ſlothfull</hi> man ſeems to have a <hi>will</hi> to doe good, but ſtill he does nothing for all this. All his <hi>actions</hi> are faint and like tepid <hi>water</hi> provoking to vomit they disguſt both <hi>God</hi> and men. Tis in vain therefore for thee to hope <hi>Salvation,</hi> unles thou firſt shakeſt of all <hi>ſloth,</hi> and reſolveſt with a firm courage to uſe a force over thyſelf to practiſe <hi>vertue.</hi> As a <hi>bird</hi> is made to <hi>fly,</hi> ſo
<hi>man</hi> is born to <hi>labour:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>God</hi> had impoſed upon us no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to labour, yet methinks the <hi>world</hi> gives us care and trouble enough.

<hi>riches,</hi> why doſt thou not uſe the ſame <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> to purchaſe eternal <hi>felicity?</hi> Ah! thou haſt reaſon to be ashamed of thy negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43202:45"/> and <hi>ſloth</hi> in a matter of ſo much conſequence, The labour is but <hi>short,</hi> the reward will be
<hi>eternall.</hi> There is nothing ſo hard and difficile, which human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry with the help of <hi>Gods</hi> grace cannot overcome. Take a good courage to begin, and all thoſe <hi>monſters</hi> of difficulties will ſoon diſappear. Whatſoever the mind hath reſolved to doe, it will at length bring it about.

<hi>Sins,</hi> of the ſame kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred race; out of which as out of an
<hi>Ocean</hi> of evills all miſcheif floweth. For when a man hath propoſed unto himſelf his own excellency for his <hi>Soveraign</hi> good, he directeth all his <hi>actions</hi> unto that end;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43202:45"/> contemning all the ſervice which is due unto <hi>God,</hi> and neglecting all reſpect which is due unto <hi>men.</hi> And if he finds there is no other way to become <hi>great</hi> but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting great <hi>crimes,</hi> he makes no ſcruple to make uſe of that means to purchaſe <hi>glory:</hi> employing all manner of craft, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining his neighbour, and plotting the death of others to arrive unto that place and dignity which his <hi>ambition</hi> ayms at. The <hi>proud</hi> man hated of God, and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amongſt men, employeth all his wit and induſtry to purchaſe the <hi>applauſe</hi> of the world. He ſtill thinks himſelf worthy of ſome greater <hi>honour,</hi> and takes much complacence in this thought. He rashly undertaketh more then he can doe, <hi>intrudes</hi> himſelf into much buſines, boaſteth of himſelf with much impudence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth all other men. He cunningly feigns himſelf <hi>humble,</hi> that ſoe he may be les ſuſpected of <hi>ambition.</hi> When he miſſeth of his aym or fals from his hopes, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth without end, raiſeth quarrels &amp; hatred amongſt his <hi>neighbours.</hi> He is fierce and churlish to his <hi>Inferiours,</hi> but no man is a greater flatterer of his
<hi>Superiours,</hi> or more slavishly obſequious to thoſe who are above him. If he is endued with any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43202:46"/> good <hi>qualities,</hi> he doth not refer the cheif glory of them to the true <hi>Author</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi> but to himſelf. He much affecteth to be ſeen, and taken notice of in all things; and giveth his jugdment of high matters which are above his capacity, with as much boldnes, as if he knew them by his own experience He
<hi>inquireth</hi> with much <hi>Curioſity</hi> into other mens actions, judgeth of them with much rashnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them with much <hi>Severity;</hi> exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates their <hi>faults,</hi> diminisheth their <hi>praiſe.</hi> In his ſpeech and gate he alwaies diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a certain <hi>Pride,</hi> and contempt of others. He hates to be corrected, refuſeth all
<hi>Counſell,</hi> and never hearkneth to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> He thinks he hath thoſe <hi>Vertues</hi> which he hath not; and thoſe which he hath, he imagines them to be much greater then they are. He is very <hi>angry,</hi> and cares not to commit any <hi>ſin,</hi> if he ſees that he is not preferred before others, or is any way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. His <hi>hart</hi> is in a continuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity: becauſe he ſees that thoſe <hi>honours</hi> which he aſpires unto, depend on other mens diſpoſing. <hi>Pride</hi> is the ſource of all <hi>ſin.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43202:46"/> afford thee, againſt the leaſt part of
<hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> felicity; and compare unto it whole <hi>Kingdomes, Empires,</hi> and the whole <hi>world:</hi> the leaſt share of this
<hi>eternall</hi> bliſſe will weigh down all the whole <hi>world</hi> with all its pompe, and riches; and all will ſeem but as a <hi>leaf,</hi> that is carried away with a blaſt of <hi>wind.</hi> Raiſe up thy mind then to think of <hi>Eternity,</hi> &amp; render thyſelf worthy of <hi>heaven,</hi> for which thou art created. Shake of all thoſe <hi>proud</hi> thoughts of thy own excellency, and labour for <hi>vertue</hi> which is the only thing that can make thee truly <hi>great.</hi> If a <hi>King</hi> or an <hi>Emperour</hi> had adopted thee for his <hi>ſon,</hi> how proud wouldeſt thou be of the
<hi>honour?</hi> But now conſidering thou art the <hi>adopted</hi> ſon of
<hi>God</hi> and redeemed with the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> why doſt thou forget thy own <hi>Origine?</hi> why doſt thou meddle with earthly and abject things, which are altogether unworrhy of thy <hi>noble</hi> birth? <hi>God</hi> calleth thee to the kingdome of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to an eternal poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, an everlaſting <hi>inheritance.</hi> Take good courage then in conſidering this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of thy heavenly <hi>maſters:</hi> boaſt as much as thou wilt of being deſcended from ſo noble a
<hi>Father,</hi> compoſe thy life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners according to the pattern of his <hi>divine</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:43202:47"/> perfections. This is the way that leads to true <hi>glory.</hi>

What are <hi>Scepters,</hi> what are <hi>Crowns?</hi> Painted fetters, a glittering miſery, which if men underſtood aright they would not fight &amp; make war for their <hi>Thrones:</hi> there would be more kingdomes, then <hi>Kings</hi> to govern them. A great <hi>fortune</hi> is a great <hi>ſlavery.</hi> Thoſe men, whom the common people eſteems happy, doe not think ſoe of themſelves For their <hi>felicity</hi> is a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>felicity,</hi> in regard it renders them burdenſome to the people. Then they begin to praiſe a quiet <hi>ſolitude,</hi> and a low
<hi>fortune;</hi> which who enjoyes, enjoyes his <hi>liberty.</hi> Then they begin to hate thoſe <hi>dignities,</hi> which before they had ſoe much admired, Then they begin with fear and aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to exclaim like
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> againſt the vanity of the <hi>world.</hi> Then they begin to fear <hi>death,</hi> and the dreadfull <hi>Judgment</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> before which when they are brought to appear, all their
<hi>diginities,</hi> all their <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> purchaſed with ſo much labour ſweat and blood will avail them juſt nothing. Live therefore after ſuch a manner that thou maiſt appear ſecurely before this
<hi>Tribunall.</hi> He that now <hi>humbles</hi> himſelf in this life, shall be <hi>exalted</hi> in the next.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:43202:47"/>4. Thou art very <hi>unwiſe,</hi> if thou thinkeſt to live in quiet and ſecurity, when thou haſt obtained ſome great <hi>dignity.</hi> That which thou canſt not find in a <hi>low</hi> ſtate, will not be found in a <hi>higher</hi> condition. The higher thou art, the more will thy crimes appear. He cannot be hid, that ſtands in a
<hi>high</hi> place. If thou haſt enjoyed any <hi>tranquillity</hi> in thy former life, all is now loſt. Henceforth thou wilt be able to doe nothing without being <hi>noted,</hi> and thou canſt not diſpoſe of one
<hi>day</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy own private will. The <hi>fall</hi> is alwaies great from high places. Tis in vain for thee to ſeek reſt in a ſtate, wherein all men find danger and labour, and ſome find a miſerable end. The tables of <hi>Princes</hi> and great men are not ſecure, <hi>Poiſon</hi> is often drunk in pretious <hi>cups.</hi> How many <hi>Kings</hi> have tainted their <hi>Thrones</hi> with their own blood? Tis <hi>ſlippery</hi> ſtanding in a high <hi>ſtation;</hi> where all things are in continuall danger of a
<hi>precipice.</hi> Tis more ſecure walking upon plain <hi>ground.</hi> He that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and applauded by many, is alſo <hi>enuyed</hi> by as many others. How many <hi>ſnares,</hi> how many <hi>treacheries</hi> wait upon
<hi>great</hi> men? how all things are unſafe, all things to be ſuſpected about them? They
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43202:48"/> cannot truſt their own

He that lives in <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,</hi> lives ſecurely. He feareth no man, becauſe no man <hi>fears</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If thou didſt ſee a <hi>horſe</hi> or a
<hi>dog</hi> pretend a Superiority or preeminence amongſt other
<hi>horſes</hi> or <hi>dogs</hi> of the ſame <hi>kind,</hi> could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou forbear laughing at it? And yet thou better deſerveſt to be laughed at, if thou thinkeſt thyſelf <hi>greater</hi> then others, becauſe thou haſt more <hi>wealth</hi> and power then they have. <hi>Why art thou proud, duſt and ashes?</hi> No man should <hi>boaſt</hi> or be <hi>proud</hi> of things which are not his own. What good or <hi>perfection</hi> haſt thou of thy own, if thou haſt received all things from the hand of <hi>God?</hi> nothing is <hi>thine</hi> but thy <hi>ſins.</hi> If then thou haſt received all things, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>thanks</hi> and glory unto him, who hath beſtowed them on thee. Shall we prefer one <hi>horſe</hi> before another, becauſe he hath more <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>oats</hi> before him, becauſe he hath a
<hi>gilt bridle,</hi> a rich <hi>ſaddle,</hi> embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>trappings?</hi> No ſure: but he that runs beſt, is the beſt
<hi>horſe.</hi> Soe a <hi>man,</hi> unles he be a <hi>fool,</hi> will not ſeek to derive his glory
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43202:48"/> from things, that are without him &amp; not properly his own. But thou wilt ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps: I am a <hi>better</hi> man, I am more <hi>noble</hi> them ſome others, If thou ſayeſt this thou art unworthy of all <hi>honour,</hi> becauſe no man juſtly deſerves to be
<hi>honoured,</hi> but he that is <hi>vertuous,</hi> and comtemns all honour and glory. True <hi>nobility</hi> is never proud, and he that is above others in <hi>dignity,</hi> is alſo above them in <hi>modeſty.</hi> the chief glory of <hi>great</hi> men is, when they humble themſelves moſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider the weaknes of thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; meaſure thy
<hi>body,</hi> and thou wilt find many things whereof thou oughteſt to be
<hi>ashamed,</hi> but nothing whereof to be <hi>proud.</hi> Doe not contemn the opinion of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians:</hi> it is true what they teach, that the whole <hi>earth</hi> is but a <hi>point</hi> compared to the vaſt extent of the heavenly <hi>ſphears.</hi> What madnes, what folly then, to divide this <hi>point</hi> into ſoe many <hi>kingdomes,</hi> ſo many <hi>Governments.</hi> No man can be <hi>great</hi> in a little ſpace. This earth, which thou treadeſt on now with ſo much pride, will cover thee ere long; and all that thou wilt poſſeſſe of it will be but juſt ſoe much as will cover thy cold body. Goe now, and build great and immortall <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:43202:49"/> upon this <hi>nothing.</hi> Goe, and exerciſe thy <hi>fury,</hi> and inſolency upon it.

If thou canſt be content to live <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> thou haſt cut of a great inticement to <hi>pride.</hi> No man lives in ſtate and pompe to pleaſe his own <hi>eyes,</hi> or the <hi>eyes</hi> of a few of his familiar friends; but the reaſon of his living with great
<hi>ſpendor</hi> is, to be <hi>noted</hi> by the world. Who would put on
<hi>purple,</hi> if he thought he should be <hi>ſeen</hi> by no man? who cares, when he eats in private, to have his meat ſerved in <hi>gold</hi> and
<hi>ſilver?</hi> who would expoſe his gallant <hi>Tapeſtries,</hi> and other rich <hi>moveables</hi> under the shadow of an old tree, where none but himſelf should look upon them? <hi>Ambition</hi> deſires to be ſeen as on a <hi>Theater,</hi> and never ſtrives to make a greater shew, then when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and applauded. If the <hi>Bee</hi> hath

<hi>praiſe,</hi> to be taken notice of, and to hear men cry, <hi>There he is: that is He.</hi> But if thou conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt well, who they are, by whom thou deſireſt to be <hi>praiſed,</hi> thou wilt not find it ſuch a hard matter to contemn the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and common ſort. The multitude is a vain and changeable <hi>rabble,</hi> whom thou thyſelf often calleſt mad; and who every moment accuſe themſelves of their own
<hi>folly,</hi> by diſapproving and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo often what they had done &amp; ſaid not long before. The life as well of him that <hi>praiſeth,</hi> as of him that if <hi>praiſed,</hi> is short: and theſe <hi>praiſes</hi> too are only given a man in a ſmall <hi>corner</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> which is all but a <hi>point:</hi> and there too all doe not agree to it, nor perhaps doth he that is <hi>praiſed</hi> beleeve all that is ſaid of him. But it is a brave thing to be ſpoken of in <hi>future</hi> ages, and to be praiſed by thoſe whom thou never ſaweſt, nor never shalt ſee. Why doſt thou not <hi>grieve</hi> alſo, for not having bine <hi>praiſed</hi> and commended by thoſe who lived before thou wert <hi>born?</hi> But ſuppoſe that thoſe who shall praiſe thee after thy <hi>death</hi> were immortall, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43202:50"/> alſo that thy <hi>memory</hi> should laſt for ever; what will this avail thee being <hi>dead?</hi> and what does it avail thee being yet <hi>alive</hi> to hear thou art praiſed? Thou art often praiſed where thou art not <hi>preſent,</hi> and at the ſame time thou art troubled or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented where thou art. The <hi>price</hi> of every thing is in the thing itſelf; and it is not made <hi>better,</hi> by being commended; nor <hi>worſe,</hi> if not praiſed. Can we ſay that the

It is a great argument of a noble <hi>Soul</hi> and one that knows it hath its

<hi>honeſt,</hi> who is too ſollicitous for his <hi>body</hi> and loueth it too much. Thou art <hi>born</hi> to greater things, and not to make thy
<hi>Soul</hi> a ſlave unto thy <hi>body:</hi> upon which thou muſt look as the <hi>priſon</hi> of thy mind, &amp; the <hi>fetters</hi> of thy liberty. The juſt and wiſe man hath a care of his <hi>body,</hi> not for the love he bears unto it, but becauſe he cannot live without it. The <hi>body</hi> is the inſtrument of the <hi>Soul:</hi> and we should eſteem that
<hi>Artiſt</hi> but a bad <hi>work-man,</hi> who inſteed of working his

<hi>pleaſures.</hi> The <hi>Senſes</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:43202:51"/> are to obey, and not to command. And in the firſt place thou oughteſt to be carefull to contain thy <hi>eyes:</hi> for the <hi>eyes</hi> being of a quick nature, and ſuddenly catching the ſeverall <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things, are apt to convey all theſe

And if unto this guard and cuſtody of thy <hi>Eyes</hi> thou canſt alſo joyn a purity of <hi>intention</hi> in thy <hi>Interiour,</hi> thou wilt find God in all things: and when thou haſt once learnt to adore
<hi>God</hi> in his creatures, thou wilt eaſily be able to raiſe up thy mind from contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the <hi>Creatures</hi> to contemplate the majeſty of
<hi>God</hi> himſelf. Beware of caſting thy eyes on a <hi>woman</hi> that paints and dreſſes herſelf to pleaſe <hi>men:</hi> she is the true picture of <hi>Incontinency:</hi> and thou art in danger to perish, in looking on her. Be not curious in going to <hi>Comedies,</hi> Balls, dances, and ſuch like <hi>Recreations:</hi> For ſuch things diſtract the mind, fill it with vain <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> and hinder it from raiſing itſelf to heavenly

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:43202:52"/> through which the knowledge of Truth and Wiſedome enters into the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Thou muſt therefore be very prudent in governing thy <hi>hearing,</hi> leaſt thy <hi>ears</hi> should admit falſehood in <hi>lieu</hi> of Truth, folly inſteed of wiſedome. Shut thy <hi>ears</hi> againſt all detraction, calumnies, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, idle rumors, and unprofitable diſcourſes: in a word, againſt all that doth not conduce in ſome manner to the good of thy <hi>Soul.</hi> For as one that hath heard good <hi>Muſick,</hi> still retains the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it in his
<hi>ears,</hi> even after he is retired from the place where he heard it; ſo euill <hi>ſpeech,</hi> although it doth not alwaies hurt juſt when we hear it, yet often-time, it ſticks for a long while in our <hi>memory,</hi> and our mind often ruminates upon it. By how much the more ſeldome thou heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt unto <hi>men,</hi> ſo much the oftner shalt thou perceive
<hi>God</hi> ſpeaking interiorly unto thy <hi>Soul.</hi> The uſe of ſweet
<hi>perfumes</hi> is the mark of effeminate perſons, and ſuch as have a bad name. Wherefore I counſell thee to reject this ſort of <hi>vanity,</hi> and to render thy life exemplar by the ſweet odour and perfume of thy
<hi>Vertues.</hi> As for thy <hi>Taſt,</hi> thou maiſt if thou wilt mortify it by <hi>abſtinence</hi> and ſobriety: but as for the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43202:52"/> ſenſe of <hi>Touching,</hi> it is to be overcome by uſing <hi>hair-cloaths,</hi> diſciplines, and ſuch other like
<hi>auſterities.</hi> It is better to afflict thy <hi>body</hi> in this world and by that means to ſave it; then to damn it and thy <hi>Soul</hi> too by conſenting to all ſort of unlawfull <hi>pleaſures.</hi>

<hi>outward</hi> habit and dreſſe of the <hi>body,</hi> have thou a ſpeciall care to banish all <hi>outward</hi> marks in thy apparell of a

Thoſe who were eſteemed the <hi>wiſe</hi> men amongſt the antient <hi>Heathens,</hi> would have an honeſt man to live ſo, as not to move a <hi>finger</hi> without ſome reaſon for it. I doe not exact from thee ſuch a <hi>ſtrict</hi> behaviour: but I could wish thou didſt obſerve it, &amp; I mention this, becauſe I would have thee abſtain from all <hi>diſſolute</hi> laughter, <hi>ſcurrilous</hi> diſcourſe, too much freedome, <hi>uncivill</hi> geſtures, and all other
<hi>rude</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: that ſo thou maiſt have nothing in thy carriage, which may give offence unto others: either by the undecency of thy cloaths, ſtern looks, unbeſeeming geſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, contempt of others, shewing a diſlike of their company, or any thing elſe which may give them a horrour and <hi>averſion</hi> from

               <p n="5">5. Man was created <hi>naked,</hi> and was not ashamed of his nakednes, becauſe he had no knowledge of it. But after he had
<hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and caſt of the robes of <hi>Innocency,</hi> which untill then was a ſufficient <hi>mantle,</hi> outward garments became afterwards ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to hide his <hi>shame.</hi> And yet ſuch is the <hi>pride</hi> and vanity of men, that what was at firſt enjoyned as a kind of
<hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> is now eſteemed a <hi>prerogative</hi> of dignity. We now ſeek <hi>cloaths,</hi> not ſo much to cover as to adorn our
<hi>bodies,</hi> and to pleaſe the ſight of others. The quality of
<hi>cloaths</hi> often diſcovers the <hi>inclinations</hi> of the mind: and to be over curious in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and compoſing ourſelves before a
<hi>looking-glaſſe</hi> shews an effeminate nature. Thou wilt ſoon be ashamed of theſe outward ornaments, if thou conſidereſt what they cover. He that is <hi>rich</hi> with the ornaments of <hi>vertue</hi> doth not need theſe outward ornaments of the <hi>body.</hi> Vertue makes the beſt shew, when it appears without <hi>disguiſe;</hi> whatſoever we adde to it to make it ſeem greater, is ſtill leſſe then <hi>vertue</hi> itſelf. Tis a meer vanity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43202:53"/> to make a fair shew <hi>without</hi> by being richly clad, and <hi>within</hi> to cover nothing but <hi>Vice.</hi> Men wilfully load themſelves with <hi>chains,</hi> but becauſe they are of
<hi>gold,</hi> they doe not apprehend the infamy of <hi>Servitude.</hi> Some again are not content to be <hi>fettererd</hi> with gold, but they will alſo
<hi>pierce</hi> their very flesh with it; to wit, when they <hi>bore</hi> their ears to hang <hi>gold rings</hi> and <hi>pendants</hi> in them, which are worth ſometimes the <hi>revenue</hi> of their whole <hi>Eſtate;</hi> making that which was once a <hi>name</hi> of punishment, now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>term</hi> of ambition, Many again ſpend much time with their <hi>comb</hi> and a looking-glaſſe, and are more ſollicitous for the <hi>neatnes</hi> of their <hi>hair,</hi> then for the ſalvation of their <hi>Soul.</hi> Such is the force of foolish opinion amongſt wordly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they think themſelves much <hi>adorned</hi> with thoſe things, which they ought rather to throw away &amp; tread under feet. Let thy <hi>cloaths</hi> therefore be without <hi>Vanity,</hi> and made not for pompe, but neceſſity: keep a decent <hi>medium,</hi> not too uncomely, but fitted to thy <hi>ſtate</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Although thou wert all dreſt with <hi>gold</hi> and pretious

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe government of our <hi>Tongue</hi> is a thing of as great importance, as the preſervation of the <hi>apple</hi> of our eye; becauſe <hi>life and death are both in the power of the Tongue.</hi> He that is not able to rule his <hi>Tongue</hi> is compared to an open <hi>Town</hi> without <hi>Walls:</hi> notwithſtanding it cannot be tamed without a ſpeciall <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Men have found a way to tame
<hi>Bears, Lyons</hi> and <hi>Bulls;</hi> and yet no man can tame his own
<hi>Tongue</hi> Our nature is ſo ſubject to <hi>pratling,</hi> that we preſently deſire to utter whatſoever comes into our <hi>mind.</hi> The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43202:54"/> 
                  <hi>tongue</hi> is ſo neer unto the
<hi>brain,</hi> and the <hi>mouth</hi> ſo neer unto the <hi>phancy,</hi> that what the <hi>fancy</hi> repreſenteth, is preſently formed into words. Nature hath taught thee, how neceſſary it is to guard thy <hi>Tongue</hi> well, ſince it hath walled it in with a double fortification of Teeth and lips. But as the ſweet ſmell of a pretious <hi>oyntment</hi> is ſoon diſſipated if the box that keeps it be left unshut, ſo the vigour of the
<hi>Soul</hi> is eaſily weakned through an open mouth; that is, by too much talking. He cannot be truly ſaid to attend unto himſelf, who doth not attend to rule his <hi>Tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ever wary in thy diſcourſe, and moderate that unbridled <hi>cuſtome</hi> (which moſt men are ſubject to) of ſpeaking without any conſideration all that comes into their <hi>fancy.</hi> Fly all diſſimulation, &amp; ſtill declare thy mind openly without all reſerved meanings. <hi>God</hi> hath given thee the faculty of ſpeaking, that thou shouldeſt uſe it to expreſſe things truly and ſincerely as they are in themſelves. Before thou ſpeakeſt conſult thy reaſon, and ſee if thou art not poſſeſſed with ſome diſordered <hi>affection;</hi> and doe not ſpeak till that <hi>paſsion</hi> is over: Otherwiſe thou maiſt ſpeak many things, which hereafter thou wilt repent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43202:55"/> to have ſpoken. Thou wilt have no
<hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> to be ſilent, provided thou art not diſturbed with ſome irregular <hi>clamors</hi> within, and that thou enjoyeſt a
<hi>peace</hi> and tranquillity of mind. Our ſpeech and mind cannot eaſily diſagree. If the <hi>mind</hi> be temperate, quiet, and in good order; our
<hi>ſpeech</hi> will alſo be ſober and good: If the mind be any way diſcompoſed with <hi>paſsions,</hi> the <hi>Tongue</hi> will alſo diſcover the ſame: for we all diſcover what we are <hi>within</hi> by our outward ſpeech.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doe not uſe thyſelf to <hi>idle</hi> words. As thou chooſeſt what to eat, ſoe <hi>chooſe</hi> what to ſpeak. Thou examineſt the <hi>meat</hi> that goes into thy <hi>mouth,</hi> and why doſt thou not examine the <hi>words</hi> that are to come out of thy <hi>mouth,</hi> which many times are occaſion of greater trouble and diſorder in thy
<hi>houſe,</hi> then thy meat is in thy <hi>ſtomack.</hi> Accuſtome thyſelf to ſpeak little unto <hi>others,</hi> and much with
<hi>thyſelf.</hi> Wiſe men often repent themſelves to have ſpoken, but never to have held their peace. Even amongſt irrationall <hi>creatures,</hi> thoſe which ſeem to have moſt <hi>wit</hi> are obſerved to make the leaſt <hi>noyſe.</hi> Too much pratling is the defect of <hi>children</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> who have naturally leſſe reaſon then <hi>men.</hi> He
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43202:55"/> hath little <hi>vertue,</hi> who is alwaies ſpeaking vain and frivolous things. If thou didſt love <hi>God</hi> and wert carefull of thy <hi>Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> all thy diſcourſe would be of
<hi>God,</hi> of vertue, and perfection. <hi>Love</hi> cannot feign, cannot be hidden. Every one commonly ſpeaks of thoſe things which he loveth; &amp; his <hi>Tongue</hi> is ever ſubject to diſcover that which his hart feeleth. The reaſon why thou ſpeakeſt ſoe little of <hi>heavenly</hi> things is, becauſe thou art ſtill plunged in the deep <hi>abiſſe</hi> of thy old <hi>vices.</hi> To which may be added another reaſon; to wit, the little reading; and leſſe <hi>meditation</hi> which thou practiſeſt: ſo that if thou hadſt a mind to ſpeak of good things, thou knoweſt not what to ſay. The <hi>mouth</hi> ſpeaketh out of the abundance of the
<hi>hart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When we are in <hi>company</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly talk of nothing elſe, but of the life, manners, and affairs of our
<hi>neighbour.</hi> Thus every man hath as many <hi>Judges</hi> of his actions, as there are heads in the <hi>city.</hi> Every one hath his eyes abroad to ſee the <hi>faults</hi> of others, and ſcarce any one keeps them at home to ſee his own <hi>imperfections:</hi> we are <hi>blind</hi> in our own concernments, and <hi>quick ſighted</hi> in what belongs to others. We are ſtill ready to hearken unto <hi>detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43202:56"/> againſt our neighbours fame, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never willing to hear any thing ſaid in his praiſe. Wherefore by how much this <hi>ſin</hi> is more common, we ought to avoid it with ſoe much more care. Thou haſt enough to doe with thy own <hi>vices;</hi> mark and correct thoſe. Take heed of revealing to any man thy own or others
<hi>ſecrets,</hi> in things which ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. Many have put themſelves into great <hi>diſquiet</hi> and trouble, by their own indiſcretion in committing their <hi>ſecrets</hi> unto ſuch as could not or would not keep them <hi>private.</hi> There is little difference, whither thou <hi>revealeſt</hi> ſuch things to one, or more. It is an eaſy matter for a <hi>ſecret</hi> to be told from one to another, and ſoe to be
<hi>diuulged</hi> to all the world. This facility of diſcovering our
<hi>mind</hi> too freely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ariſeth from talkiing too much and too long; ſoe that we take a pleaſure in <hi>talking,</hi> which hath the ſame effect on our mind as <hi>drunkenes</hi> would have: for by this it happens, that there is no <hi>ſecret</hi> however ſoe private and holy, which doth not come forth in diſcourſe. He with whom thou talkeſt, firſt tells thee his <hi>ſecrets,</hi> and thou upon this as being aſſured of his <hi>faithfulnes</hi> preſently diſcovereſt thine alſo
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43202:56"/> unto him. But thou perhaps art <hi>true</hi> unto him in keeping his <hi>ſecrets,</hi> whilſt he is <hi>unfaithfull</hi> unto thee and revealeth thine unto every one he meets: ſoe that by this means although they are all ignorant of thy buſines in <hi>publick,</hi> yet thy all know it in <hi>private.</hi> A man would think that a hundred
<hi>Tongues</hi> did ſecretly fly to all <hi>ears,</hi> untill at laſt that which was a <hi>ſecret</hi> is now diuulged, and become a common
<hi>report.</hi> All the miſchief committed under the <hi>heavens</hi> hath bine either cauſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, or promoted by the <hi>Tongue.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make a <hi>balance</hi> for thy words, and bridle thy
<hi>Tongue:</hi> and never ſpeak any thing which had bine better unſpoken. It is more commendable to be ſparing in thy <hi>words,</hi> then in thy
<hi>mony.</hi> He that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſpends his <hi>mony,</hi> does good to others, although he is bad to himſelf: but he that is prodigall of
<hi>words,</hi> hurteth others, and himſelf too. He imitateth the perfections of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> who can be content to hear much, and ſay little.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nothing is ſecure from an evill <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</hi> The
<hi>Princes</hi> of the world are not free from <hi>calumnies,</hi> though their power and authority hath placed them above the reach of their

A <hi>friend</hi> is carried away to
<hi>priſon.</hi> What then, what hath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43202:58"/> hapned? nothing, but that he is put in
<hi>priſon.</hi> But every man preſently cryes, that he is an
<hi>unhappy</hi> man. Correct thy <hi>opinion,</hi> and all things are wll. As we <hi>bind</hi> a man that is run <hi>mad,</hi> that he may hurt no body; ſoe we should correct our <hi>fancy,</hi> that it may not fill our mind with
<hi>falſe</hi> opinions. It is our <hi>fancy</hi> that ſpoyls all: it eſcapes from us like a wild <hi>beaſt,</hi> and runs with all
<hi>liberty</hi> here and there: it is alwaies va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond, alwaies pratling, impatient of <hi>reſt,</hi> deſirous of <hi>novelties,</hi> and keepeth no moderation. Thy chiefeſt care then muſt be, to <hi>bind,</hi> govern, and ſettle it; to the end that thy thoughts and deſigns may not ſtill depend on the <hi>opinion</hi> of others. All that is not <hi>bred</hi> in thy own thoughts, doth not concern thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Examine well all that comes into thy <hi>mind,</hi> that thou maiſt throughly know the nature, propriety, end, circumſtances, &amp; profit of every <hi>action,</hi> before thou doeſt it: conſider whither it <hi>concerns</hi> thee, &amp; whither it be in thy power or no: otherwiſe, give it no admittance, but reſiſt it as much as thou canſt.
<hi>God</hi> who is alwaies and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately preſent to thee knows all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of thy hart, and there is nothing ſo hidden, which his
<hi>eye</hi> doth not reach.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43202:59"/> Take heed thou doſt not <hi>meditate</hi> any thing in thy <hi>mind,</hi> which thou wouldeſt be <hi>asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> to ſpeak before any <hi>honeſt</hi> man. Let thy <hi>thoughts</hi> be quiet, ſimple, pure, &amp; void of all <hi>malice.</hi> In a word let them be ſuch, that being ſuddenly asked what thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, thou maiſt openly declare without any <hi>shame</hi> what they were. Be ashamed to <hi>think</hi> what thou art ashamed to <hi>ſpeak.</hi> The way to keep out all evill
<hi>thoughts,</hi> is to have our <hi>mind</hi> alwaies employed in good things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nothing is more hurtfull to the <hi>Soul,</hi> nothing more contrary then that <hi>brutish,</hi> inferior, and ſenſitive deſire. It is the <hi>ſource</hi> of all <hi>vice</hi> and imperfections: it is an
<hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> which thou oughteſt alwaies to fear, alwaies to fight againſt, untill that thou haſt made it ſubject unto reaſon, as much as is poſſible in this life. It will give thee no reſt, no <hi>Truce.</hi> Thou wilt be forced to <hi>fight</hi> againſt it without end, without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe it is an <hi>adverſary</hi> that hath no end, no meaſure in attacking thee. It is an <hi>enemy</hi> that is <hi>within</hi> thee, or as I may ſay thou art thy own <hi>enemy,</hi> more to be feared then if a whole <hi>army</hi> were ſet againſt thee. Defend therefore thy
<hi>Soul</hi> from thyſelf. It is an act of greater <hi>generoſity</hi> to attack thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43202:59"/> then to attack a <hi>Town:</hi> to conquer thyſelf, then to conquer others. Tis not that I exact of thee that thou shouldeſt wholly deſtroy thy <hi>paſsions</hi> &amp; inclinations, but that thou wouldſt learn to govern them. Let <hi>reaſon</hi> moderate and refrain them, which is all that is required of thee. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> had little reaſon in their <hi>doctrine</hi> when they maintained that all
<hi>paſsions</hi> were bad. Our naturall <hi>faculties</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bad, nothing ſuperfluous. He takes away all <hi>vertue,</hi> who takes away all <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Where there is no <hi>combat,</hi> there is no
<hi>victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Tis true, this is a hard <hi>combat,</hi> &amp; the
<hi>victory</hi> is doubtfull: for our <hi>paſsions</hi> are born and grow with us, and our <hi>reaſon</hi> follows a long time after, when our
<hi>paſsions</hi> have got the <hi>upper</hi> hand, and our will being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded under pretenſe of a feeming good, permits itſelf to be wholly
<hi>overſwayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> by them: untill <hi>reaſon</hi> afterwards and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience gathering ſtrength comes to know her own <hi>right</hi> of commanding, and then begins to reſiſt the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of our paſſions. The firſt <hi>motions</hi> of nature are hard to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: but thou muſt alwaies attend unto thyſelf with great <hi>watchfulnes,</hi> &amp; as ſoon as thou perceiveſt thyſelf to be moved
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43202:60"/> with any <hi>paſsion,</hi> then preſently employ thy <hi>reaſon</hi> to hinder the violence of it. It is eaſier to reſiſt them in the <hi>beginning,</hi> then to govern them in their <hi>violence.</hi> Thou wilt ſoon arrive to great <hi>tranquillity</hi> of mind, if thou canſt accuſtome thyſelf to foreſee all occaſions, before they happen; that ſo the <hi>enemy</hi> may alwaies find thee prepared againſt him. It is too late to ſeek for the <hi>remedy,</hi> when the
<hi>danger</hi> is paſt. In the next place, learn to doe and ſpeak little; for if thou cutteſt of in thy words and actions all that is not neceſſary, thou wilt have leſſe trouble of mind. Doe not ſay, this is a thing of no great importance or concern. Whatſoever is the beginning of
<hi>vertue</hi> and perfection, although it ſeem of little conſequence, is notwithſtanding a matter of great <hi>concern.</hi>
               </p>

The originall and ſinfull <hi>man</hi> which is derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> if we conſider him as bearing the reſſemblance of a <hi>Tree,</hi> hath for his <hi>root</hi> ſelflove, for his <hi>trunk</hi> a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto evill, for his <hi>boughs,</hi> his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered paſſions, for his <hi>leaves</hi> vitious habits, for his

The means to <hi>root</hi> it out is to contemn thyſelf: to eſteem thyſelf the leaſt amongſt men, and that thou haſt no <hi>preeminence</hi> before others either in learning, vertue or other prerogatives; not to be afraid to <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> men, and be contemned by them; to be willing to want all comfort, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commodities.

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>LOve</hi> is a compleaſance of <hi>Good,</hi> or the firſt impreſſion which is made upon our deſires, when the knowledge of <hi>Good</hi> begins to make us like it. Tis this which rules all the world; which if once ſubdued, and brought to obey, it will be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43202:61"/> an eaſy matter to overcome all our other
<hi>paſsions.</hi> True <hi>love</hi> ever tends unto that, from whence it had its beginning: it ſtill inclineth to <hi>Good,</hi> becauſe it is derived from the <hi>Soveraign Good.</hi> Examine thy life, and weigh thy hart in the <hi>balance</hi> of a ſtrict conſideration: obſerve what ſort of
<hi>love</hi> prevaileth in it; for, that which weighs heavieſt in the balance of <hi>love,</hi> that is thy <hi>God,</hi> that is the <hi>Idol</hi> which thou adoreſt. <hi>God</hi> hath commanded thee to love him with all thy hart, to this end, that he might keep thy mind and affections employed; becauſe it is certain that that which thou <hi>loueſt</hi> with all thy hart, is the thing which thou adoreſt as thy <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Tis not only goodnes and beauty, which makes us
<hi>love</hi> any perſon, but alſo a certain <hi>ſympathy</hi> and proportion of mind and manners, as alſo an exterior modeſty, induſtry, noble birth, learning, quicknes of wit, and ſuch like other endowments of body and mind. <hi>Love</hi> itſelf is the <hi>load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> of
<hi>love,</hi> which if accompanied with any curteſy or civility, he is now forced to return <hi>love,</hi> who before would not begin to love. In fine, ſome have more naturall inclination to <hi>love</hi> then others. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thoſe who are of a lively ſpirit, a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43202:61"/> tender hart, a delicate blood, a ſweet &amp; facile nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The power of <hi>Love</hi> is very great; it transformeth him that <hi>loveth</hi> into the thing <hi>loved. Love</hi> is a kind of ſally &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering out of ourſelves; a kind of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>death.</hi> He that <hi>loveth</hi> is abſent from himſelf: thinks nothing of himſelf, takes care of nothing, does nothing, and unles he is received by the perſon <hi>loved,</hi> he ſeems to himſelf to be ſetled no where. Oh how unhappy is that <hi>love,</hi> which is not directed to
<hi>God.</hi> For he that loveth the <hi>objects</hi> of this world, cannot dwell in them, nor find any ſolid contentment in them; becauſe they are limited, ſubject to vanity and death. But he that loveth <hi>God,</hi> is in
<hi>God;</hi> and ceaſing to live in himſelf, lives in him, in whom all things live, who is our <hi>center,</hi> and immutable <hi>Souveraign Good.</hi> Human <hi>love</hi> is violent and bitter; divine <hi>love</hi> is alwaies humble, and peaceable: human love is tormented with
<hi>jealouſy,</hi> but we need not fear any <hi>Rivall</hi> in divine love. The one fears leaſt another should <hi>love</hi> the ſame object, the other wisheth all may <hi>love</hi> the ſame he <hi>loveth.</hi> Wherefore if thou
<hi>loveſt</hi> thyſelf, love <hi>God:</hi> for this <hi>love</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth thee, not him. Any human <hi>object</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:43202:62"/> may change or perish: but <hi>God</hi> is never loſt, unles we wilfully diſmiſſe him from our <hi>harts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>love,</hi> wherewith thou
<hi>loueſt</hi> thy neighbor may be ſincere, be ſure to exclude from it all human <hi>cauſes</hi> of wit, compleaſance, and ſimilitude: and regard only thoſe <hi>cauſes,</hi> which conſiſt in piety and vertue. That ſort of <hi>Love,</hi> which is called <hi>Platonick,</hi> and by which ſome fancy that the <hi>Soul</hi> is raiſed from the ſight of a
<hi>corporall</hi> beauty to contemplate the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> beauty of
<hi>God,</hi> is very dangerous. The ſight of a beautifull face raiſeth a deſire of touching it: and whatſoever it is that proceedeth from the
<hi>eyes</hi> of a beautifull perſon, whither it be a light, or ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſpirit or humor, it bewitcheth a mans <hi>hart,</hi> and is often the occaſion of his <hi>ruine.</hi> It is better and more ſafe that our
<hi>feet</hi> should occaſion our fall to the ground, then our <hi>eyes</hi> be the occaſion of our falling into <hi>ſin.</hi> But the <hi>remedies</hi> of love are very hard, becauſe whilſt we ſeek to overcome it, the more it torments us; and unles we reſiſt it in the beginning, it ſo creepeth by little and little, that we find ourſelves much entangled in <hi>love,</hi> before me thought of <hi>louing.</hi> But if we reſiſt it in the firſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43202:62"/> beginning, tis eaſy to be <hi>cured.</hi> Tis not amiſſe likewiſe, to keep our <hi>mind</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in other things, which bring ſome <hi>care</hi> with them, and may blot out the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>object</hi> we love. Then we ought to avoid all things that may bring it again into our mind, as ſeeing, and ſpeaking of it; for nothing is ſooner renewed then <hi>love,</hi> which if it once
<hi>invade</hi> thee, and take poſſeſſion of thy <hi>hart,</hi> it wil ſoe vexe thee, that nothing but the ſlow <hi>remedy</hi> of time and abſence will be able to <hi>cure</hi> thee of it; to wit, when tyred with long ſufferings it will expire of itſelf. Many have bine <hi>cured</hi> by shame; to wit, when they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they were noted, talkt of, &amp; poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at by all that knew them; as alſo by conſidering the
<hi>shamefulnes</hi> of it, being a thing full of <hi>diſgrace,</hi> full of
<hi>danger,</hi> and ſubject to much <hi>ſorrow</hi> in the end. Others have found help by ſeeking into and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering attentively the defects and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>object</hi> they had loved; for by this means the
<hi>beauty</hi> and lovelynes of it is much leſſened. Laſtly, it is a good <hi>remedy</hi> to change our <hi>love</hi> into the love of <hi>God,</hi> into the love of <hi>vertue</hi> and eternall rewards, things which truly deſerve to be <hi>loved;</hi> that ſoe good <hi>love</hi> may drive out
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43202:63"/> our bad love, and our mind which was created for more <hi>noble</hi> objects blush to ſoil and defile itſelf with
<hi>terrene</hi> objects. Evill and dishoneſt <hi>loves</hi> cannot but infect good <hi>manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Nature</hi> ſeems to have tyed all things together with a certain <hi>chayn</hi> of love. Tis <hi>love</hi> which governs, and makes the <hi>Stars</hi> coneur in their motions and influences: tis <hi>love</hi> which gathers together ſuch vaſt flocks of <hi>birds</hi> in the ayr, ſuch vaſt <hi>heards</hi> of <hi>catitle</hi> in the fields and mountains, ſuch vaſt troops of wild <hi>beaſts</hi> in the woods and deſerts. Nothing can untye this holy knot of <hi>love,</hi> but
<hi>Hatred:</hi> for as <hi>love</hi> tends to union, ſo <hi>hatred</hi> tends to diviſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention. Thoſe who are moſt ſubject unto this paſſion of <hi>hatred,</hi> are idle, fearfull, &amp; ſuſpicious perſons, who fear ſome loſſe or miſcheif on all <hi>ſides.</hi> Some again are of ſuch a nature, that they <hi>hate</hi> all men, and like thoſe <hi>birds</hi> of evill fortune hate even their own dark habitations. If thou shouldeſt chance to meet any one of this <hi>temper;</hi> doe not hate, but pity him. Even as in a <hi>fencing</hi> ſchool thou ſtriveſt (quietly and without anger) to defend thyſelf from him that <hi>fenceth</hi> againſt thee; ſo in all thy life, decline and avoid thoſe who
<hi>hate</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:43202:63"/> thee, without <hi>hatred.</hi> The way to refrain <hi>hatred</hi> in thyſelf is to endeavor to excite thy mind to a
<hi>love</hi> of that perſon by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſome perfection in him whom thou <hi>hateſt</hi> There will be no place in thy hart for <hi>hatred</hi> againſt any man, if thou canſt <hi>interprete</hi> all things to the beſt. Then turn thy <hi>hatred</hi> againſt thoſe things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be <hi>hated,</hi> as the deformity of <hi>Sin</hi> and eternall damnation. If thou <hi>hateſt</hi> any thing elſe, the dammage and hurt falls upon thyſelf, and not upon the <hi>object</hi> which thou <hi>hateſt.</hi> For if we are commanded to <hi>love</hi> even our <hi>Enemies,</hi> whom can we
<hi>hate?</hi> Thou muſt fly out of the <hi>Society</hi> of men, to find thoſe whom thou maiſt lawfully <hi>hate.</hi> All <hi>evill</hi> is to be ranked by itſelf, out of the <hi>order</hi> of naturall things, and tis that alone which thou art permitted to <hi>hate.</hi> But if thou wilt needs
<hi>hate</hi> a man, <hi>hate</hi> none more then thyſelf; for no
<hi>man</hi> hath done thee ſoe much <hi>hurt,</hi> as <hi>thou</hi> haſt done to thyſelf.</p>

<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who being free from the ſlavery of <hi>fortune</hi> ſeemed in the midſt of moſt cruell <hi>torments</hi> to be as happy as
<hi>Angels.</hi> For whilſt they contemplated the <hi>limits</hi> of human power, they were eaſily perſuaded that nothing but their own thoughts and affections was truly in their own power. And by means of this
<hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> they obtained ſuch a power over their own
<hi>affections,</hi> and were able to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43202:65"/> govern their <hi>paſsions</hi> in ſuch a manner, that they bragged (and not without ſome reaſon) that they were the only <hi>rich,</hi> the only <hi>powerfull,</hi> the only <hi>happy</hi> men in this world. But there is need of much practiſe to be able to
<hi>contemn</hi> all theſe externall things. If thou canſt once bring thyſelf to this, thou wilt never after be ſorry for the want of ſuch things as are witnout thee; as thou doſt not complain that thou art not
<hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> or that thou wanteſt <hi>wings</hi> to fly. What is <hi>withont</hi> us, doth not belong to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tis this that muſt <hi>bridle</hi> thy deſires, which if thou canſt not govern thou wilt never content thy inſatiable mind, and whatſoever thou giveſt it, it will not make an end of thy
<hi>avarice,</hi> but only ſerve to <hi>irritate</hi> it the more. Thoſe who are in a burning <hi>feavor</hi> can never drink enough; becauſe their deſire of <hi>drink</hi> is not ſo much a <hi>thirſt,</hi> as a diſeaſe: ſoe it happens with thoſe, whoſe <hi>deſires</hi> are not moderated, and kept within the compaſſe of <hi>reaſon,</hi> but are guided according to luxe &amp; pomp, which have no end or bounds. Thou wilt find the want of nothing, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt thyſelf within the
<hi>bounds</hi> of nature and reaſon; but if thou exceedeſt this, thou
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43202:65"/> wilt ever be <hi>poor</hi> in the midſt of all thy riches. <hi>Avarice</hi> hath never <hi>enough,</hi> but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is content with <hi>little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Remember thou art to comport thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this life, as in a <hi>banquet.</hi> If any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate</hi> meat is brought in and preſented to thee, ſtretch out thy <hi>hand</hi> modeſtly &amp; take a part of it. If he that carries it about from one end of the <hi>table</hi> to the other should chance to miſſe thee, doe not call to him or pull him by the <hi>sleeve.</hi> If he is not yet come nigh thee, doe not shew thyſelf
<hi>greedy</hi> by looking towards him, but ſtay untill he comes to thee. If thou doſt uſe the ſame <hi>prudence</hi> in order to riches, dignities, &amp; the like, thou wilt be worthy of the banquet of <hi>Saints,</hi> and thou wilt enjoy ſuch peace of mind, which will place thee above all the
<hi>chances</hi> of fortune. But if thou abſolutely refuſeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſt what is offered thee, thou wilt be made partaker of the felicity of <hi>Angells,</hi> &amp; thou wilt begin to taſt upon <hi>earth</hi> that which they enjoy in <hi>heaven.</hi> It is in thy power to make thyſelf happy, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt nothing that is without thee. What man is
<hi>happy?</hi> He that hath what he <hi>deſires.</hi> He then that deſireth nothing but what is in his own power, hath all that he deſires.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:43202:66"/>5. We fly and avoid many things as hurtfull and contrary to our <hi>nature,</hi> which notwithſtanding are very profitable in themſelves. For it commonly happens that what is contrary to our <hi>inclinations,</hi> is good for our <hi>ſpirit.</hi> Things which
<hi>afflict</hi> us, teach us <hi>wiſedome.</hi> Death, banishment, poverty, confuſion, labour, ſicknes, and the like, which are not in thy power, are neither <hi>bad</hi> in themſelves, nor doe they belong unto thee. Wherefore it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thou shouldeſt fly or hate them, but only change the
<hi>opinion</hi> thou hadſt of them. <hi>Socrates</hi> wittily termed all theſe things <hi>Masks</hi> or <hi>vizards:</hi> for as children are frightned with <hi>vizards,</hi> although there is nothing dreadfull in them but the outward <hi>shape:</hi> ſoe it happens with thee, who art often afraid of things not as they are, but as they ſeem. What is death! A
<hi>bugbear.</hi> Conſider how ſweet it hath bine eſteemed, not only by
<hi>Saints,</hi> and holy men, but alſo by <hi>Socrates</hi> and many others of the wiſer <hi>Heathens.</hi> What then is there <hi>terrible</hi> in death? <hi>Opinion.</hi> Tis the fear of <hi>death</hi> that is dreadfull, and not death itſelf. Thou wilt find the ſame in other things, which thou art wont to abominate and fear. Correct thy <hi>opinion</hi> of things, and thou wilt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43202:66"/> find that nothing is to be feared, nothing to be abominated but <hi>Sin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sadnes</hi> is cauſed by a certain horrour, or apprehenſion of ſome preſent <hi>evill,</hi> joyned with a certain perturbation and diſquiet of <hi>mind.</hi> We are often <hi>tormented</hi> not ſoe much with the things themſelves, as with the <hi>opinion</hi> of them. Doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thyſelf ſoe much with the <hi>nature</hi> and quality of things; for example, the ſervices of others, thy lands, thy money, thy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: but rather conſider what <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> thou haſt of them. If thou art fallen into <hi>diſgrace,</hi> if thou art robbed of thy
<hi>money,</hi> if thou art beaten, or the like: theſe are things which are not in thy power: but it is in thy power to have a good <hi>opinion</hi> of them, to bear them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and receive them from the hand of <hi>God</hi> as means to work thy <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:43202:67"/> Thou wilt never be <hi>ſad,</hi> if recalling thy mind from the thoughts of thy preſent <hi>afflictions,</hi> thou turneſt thyſelf to conſider the joyes of <hi>heaven.</hi> No evill or misfortune can happen to a <hi>vertuous</hi> man, not becauſe he is inſenſible to the <hi>blows</hi> of fortune, but becauſe he overcometh all. He looks upon every <hi>adverſity</hi> as an occaſion to exerciſe his <hi>patience,</hi> as an inſtrument of <hi>Gods</hi> grace, as the way leading unto eternall glory. A good man may be thought or termed
<hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> by others, but he can never be ſoe in his own thoughts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Look upon all things which may <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi> as if they really were to befall thee. By this means, thou wilt diminish the force of all <hi>miſeries,</hi> which never come <hi>unexpected</hi> unto thoſe who are prepared to receive them. <hi>Afflictions</hi> ſeem intolerable only unto thoſe who expect nothing but <hi>proſperity.</hi> What if <hi>fortune</hi> should deprive thee of half thy <hi>eſtate?</hi> what if thou shouldſt looſe all? what if thy <hi>houſe</hi> should fall, thy <hi>corn</hi> be burnt, thy <hi>friends</hi> forſake thee? what if thou art in danger of looſing thy <hi>credit,</hi> and by ſome falſe <hi>accuſation</hi> art depoſed from thy <hi>office</hi> or dignity?

<hi>wiſe</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:43202:68"/> man. He premeditates all future miſery, and what to others ſeems leſſe only by long <hi>patience,</hi> to him is leſſened by long <hi>meditation.</hi> That which happens to one man, may
<hi>happen</hi> to any man. What <hi>riches</hi> are there, which may not change into hunger and <hi>poverty?</hi> what dignities, which may not fall into miſery and diſgrace? what <hi>kingdome,</hi> which muſt not at laſt come to a <hi>period?</hi> Have we not ſeen in this our age a
<hi>Kings</hi> head ſtruck of by the hand of a <hi>hang-man,</hi> and that by the command of his own <hi>rebell</hi> ſubjects? There is no ſuch great diſtance as we imagine betwixt riches and poverty, betwixt a <hi>Princes</hi> court and a <hi>shephards</hi> cottage, betwixt a <hi>Throne</hi> and an
<hi>Axe.</hi> Know then that all conditions are variable; and all that thou ſeeſt <hi>happen</hi> to another, the ſame may befall thee. He will eaſily bear a croſſe fortune, that alwaies expects it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Vertue</hi> doth not flourish, when our life paſſeth in all <hi>proſperity.</hi> Tis then we ſee how great is is, when <hi>patience</hi> sheweth what it can ſuffer. <hi>We are made a ſpectacle unto God, Angels, and men,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Behold a ſpectacle worthy of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, to wit, when a <hi>vertuous</hi> man in the midſt of <hi>Adverſity</hi> triumpheth over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43202:68"/> and the affliction too. A skilfull
<hi>Pilot</hi> cannot shew his art in a <hi>calm</hi> ſea, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable wind. <hi>He that is never tempted, knows nothing.</hi> Ah! how unhappy a man am I (will ſome one ſay) that am forced to ſuffer theſe
<hi>misfortunes.</hi> But I tell thee, thou art happy; becauſe thou haſt an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to try thy <hi>vertue.</hi> Such a thing might have hapned to any one elſe; but every one elſe perhaps could bear ſuch <hi>afflictions</hi> without complaining. Doe not therefore fall under the weight of
<hi>Adverſity;</hi> but ſtand up firmly againſt it, and endeavor to bear all patiently that is laid upon thee. If thou canſt but break the firſt
<hi>shock,</hi> thou wilt find nothing hard in it but <hi>opinion.</hi> Naturall ſufferances are equally hard unto all ſort of men: but as for poverty, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, contumelies, and ſuch like things which are commonly eſteemed <hi>Evills,</hi> many bear them all with great <hi>patience,</hi> &amp; ſeem in a manner inſenſible in them; wherefore if we are grieved, ſad, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in them, this doth not proceed from the <hi>nature</hi> of the things, but from the bad <hi>opinion</hi> we have conceived of them. Why wilt thou deceive thyſelf with a falſe perſuaſion? It is in thy own power to make all <hi>calamity</hi> eaſy, by bearing it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.

               <p n="2">2. Thou shouldeſt often conſider, that all that is

<hi>fears</hi> are vain, and therefore they trouble us more, becauſe they are
<hi>vain.</hi> Things which are <hi>true</hi> have a certain meaſure, but that which is <hi>doubtfull</hi> &amp; uncertain is nothing but the
<hi>conjecture</hi> of a timorous mind. There is little difference betwixt ſuffering <hi>adverſity</hi> and expecting it: only that <hi>ſorrow</hi> hath a certain meaſure, but <hi>fear</hi> is boundles and without end. Thou

               <p n="3">3. Turn thy mind from thy own <hi>private</hi> cauſe to conſider the <hi>common</hi> miſery of the world. Say to thyſelf: I know that my <hi>body</hi> is frayl and mortall; ſubject unto many, miſeries, and muſt at laſt yeild to <hi>death.</hi> I knew long agoe, that many
<hi>afflictions</hi> would befall me. What then am I now <hi>afraid</hi> of? If I am <hi>ſick;</hi> the infirmity of my <hi>body</hi> will conduce to my
<hi>ſpirituall</hi> health. Shall I be reduced to <hi>poverty?</hi> I shall lead a more ſafe and quiet life. Shall I looſe my <hi>riches?</hi> I shall alſo be quit of many cares, and freed from continuall <hi>danger.</hi> Shall I ſuffer any <hi>shame?</hi> if it be <hi>juſt,</hi> I will hate the cauſe of it: if <hi>unjuſt,</hi> I shall comfort myſelf with the
<hi>innocency</hi> of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Shall I come short of my
<hi>hopes?</hi> I will conſider that even <hi>Kings</hi> are not able to obtain all which they deſire. Shall I be <hi>banished?</hi> I will goe with a willing mind and I will eſteem it as a <hi>pilgrimage:</hi> Shall I be
<hi>blind?</hi> by this means I shall not ſee ſuch <hi>objects</hi> as move
<hi>concupiſcence.</hi> Will men <hi>ſpeak</hi> ill of me? They will only
<hi>ſay</hi> what I deſerve, and doe as they are wont. Shall I
<hi>dye?</hi> I know I came into the world on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43202:73"/> this condition, to goe out again. But shal I <hi>dye</hi> abroad? no contrey is a <hi>banishment</hi> to him that conſiders we have no <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent City</hi> in this world. Shall I dye
<hi>yong,</hi> and before my time? no reaſonable man should complain that he is releaſed out of <hi>priſon</hi> too ſoon and before his time. Death, banishment, and ſorrow are not pains to be <hi>feared,</hi> but the
<hi>Tributes</hi> of our mortall condition. It is a folly to <hi>fear</hi> that, which thou canſt not avoid.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not too confident, or bold; and undertake nothing above thy <hi>forces:</hi> for no man is ſooner <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> then he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth too much of himſelf. Our <hi>forces</hi> are but weak without <hi>Gods</hi> help, from whom cometh all our power, all our ſtrength.
<hi>Boldnes</hi> ever proceeds from too much eſteem of our own ſtrength, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> from a haſty <hi>wit,</hi> and a mind not much accuſtomed to the <hi>management</hi> of affairs. He that is more <hi>wiſe,</hi> feareth more: for he meaſureth his own forces, and conſiders what he is able to bear, and what not. <hi>Bold</hi> perſons when they are fallen into ſome great <hi>dangers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they expected, reſiſt a little, but preſently looſe <hi>courage;</hi> being forced at laſt to confeſſe that human <hi>counſells</hi> are full
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43202:73"/> of vanity &amp; incertitude. A careles unwary <hi>ſecurity</hi> is the beginning of future <hi>miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Anger</hi> will never overmaſter thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if thou firſt takeſt away the opinion of a ſuppoſed <hi>injury.</hi> Thou art <hi>thyſelf</hi> the cauſe of all thy own evills, miſery, and ſufferings? Why doſt thou caſt the blame of all thy diſquiet upon
<hi>others,</hi> if thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt into them by thy own fault? No man is hurt but by himſelf. As <hi>nurſes</hi> uſe to ſay unto children; <hi>doe not cry, and thou shalt have it:</hi> thou maiſt ſay the ſame with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon unto thyſelf when thou art moved with anger: <hi>Be not angry, doe not make a ſtir,</hi> and <hi>thou wilt ſooner obtain what thou deſireſt.</hi> Reſolve with thyſelf upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dayes, not to be
<hi>angry</hi> at all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever shall happen: and ſoe try thyſelf after this manner for a <hi>month</hi> or two, and thou wilt find in time that thou haſt much profited by it and thou wilt <hi>laugh</hi> at thoſe things which formerly were wont to make thee <hi>angry,</hi> and diſquiet thy mind. A quiet and ſweet <hi>diſpoſition</hi> is not only gratefull to thoſe with whom we <hi>converſe,</hi> but alſo is moſt advantageous unto him that is endowed with it. A <hi>quiet</hi> mind hath this advantage, that it alwaies <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,</hi> alwaies triumpheth.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Firſt we muſt keep our mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from <hi>Curioſity.</hi> Why doſt thou employ thy <hi>mind</hi> in vain things, ſince it was created for <hi>God,</hi> and ſolid wiſedome?
<hi>Wiſedome</hi> is thrifty. As he that taſteth the hearb

Doſt thou deſire to know the courſe, force, and influence of the

                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43202:76"/> how to meaſure <hi>Lands:</hi> how much better would it be that thou wouldeſt <hi>learn</hi> to meaſure and know what is enough for thee. <hi>Arithmetick</hi> teaches thee how to caſt
<hi>accounts,</hi> and how to apply thy fingers to <hi>Avarice:</hi> why doſt thou not rather learn to contemn and to be willing to looſe thoſe
<hi>riches,</hi> which are gathered with ſoe much care. <hi>Muſick</hi> teaches thee how to accord different <hi>voyces:</hi> why doſt thou not rather learn how to <hi>accord</hi> thy own thoughts, ſoe that thy Reaſon and thy ſenſes may not <hi>diſagree,</hi> or give a different

<hi>Tunes:</hi> learn rather how to comport thyſelf in <hi>proſperity</hi> without pride, and how to ſuffer <hi>Adverſity</hi> with patience, &amp; reſignation. I doe not blame the <hi>ſtudy</hi> and knowledge of thoſe

               <p n="5">5. Tis a shamefull <hi>vice</hi> to be alwaies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>actions</hi> of others, to be alwaies ſearching into their <hi>manners,</hi> and rashly to interpret all things in an ill
<hi>ſenſe.</hi> For <hi>Who art thou, that judgeſt another mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43202:76"/> To his his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> It is he that <hi>judges</hi> all men, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all
<hi>judgment</hi> to himſelf. With what boldnes dareſt thou attempt to judge in <hi>Gods</hi> tribunall? Look to thyſelf, and ſearch into thy own
<hi>conſcience.</hi> See the evills which reign there within thee, ſee the good which is wanting, and doe not turn thy <hi>eyes</hi> to behold the life of others. Thou wilt find imperfections enough in thyſelf, which deſerve thy
<hi>cenſure.</hi> There is ſcarce any thing, which by a malitious ſpirit may not be <hi>interpreted</hi> to a bad ſenſe. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> abuſe the very <hi>Goſpell</hi> itſelf: the <hi>Jews,</hi> calumniate the actions of our B <hi>Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Even as <hi>melancholy</hi> bodyes and ſuch as are of a bad <hi>temper</hi> convert all their nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into evill
<hi>humors,</hi> ſoe a <hi>ſoul</hi> that is full of evill diſpoſitions, whatſoever it ſees, whatſoever it hears, it ſtill interprets all to a bad ſenſe. A good or bad <hi>intention</hi> often maketh mens <hi>actions</hi> good or bad; but this <hi>intention</hi> is known only unto <hi>God,</hi> who ſees the <hi>harts</hi> of men. But if the
<hi>actions</hi> of other men cannot be excuſed from being bad, what is this to thee? why art thou not ashamed to diſcover the fowl and hidden
<hi>ſins</hi> of others, &amp; to make them known to all the world? why doſt thou
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43202:77"/> not obſerve thyſelf, who art worſe then others? Exerciſe thy <hi>cenſuring</hi> Tongue upon thyſelf, blame thy own <hi>actions</hi> within thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, accuſe thy own malice, and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and <hi>judge</hi> thyſelf. For if thou doſt fiſt
<hi>judge</hi> thy ſelf, thou wilt be ſecure from the rigorous
<hi>judgments</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As we are alwaies ready to <hi>cenſure</hi> &amp; carp at the <hi>actions</hi> of others, ſeeking by this means to be eſteemed wiſe and diſcreet: Soe we are apt to ſuſpect that others think or ſpeak ill of us; and that they hate and contemn us. That thou maiſt overcome this <hi>vice,</hi> endeavor firſt to moderate in thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the deſire of pleaſing, and to be well eſteemed of by others. In the next place, thou muſt endeavor to remove out of thy <hi>mind</hi> the thought of deſiring to know what others think or ſpeak of thee: whereas it often happens that thoſe whom thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt to <hi>ſpeak</hi> ill of thee &amp; to mark thy actions, doe not ſoe much as think of thee. Say with .S.
<hi>Paul: If I should pleaſe men, I should not be the Servant of Jeſus-Chriſt.</hi> Whatever others ſpeak of thee, doe thou ſtill ſay with the ſame <hi>Apoſtle: To me it is a thing of leaſt account to be judged of men.</hi> Such as thou art in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> ſuch thou art in thyſelf. What others think and ſpeak
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43202:77"/> of thee cannot make thee better or worſe. It is better to be <hi>good,</hi> then only <hi>ſeem</hi> to be ſoe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Nothing can happen contrary to thy <hi>will,</hi> if thou canſt wholly renounce thy own <hi>will,</hi> and ſeek nothing but to
<hi>conform</hi> thyſelf to the will of <hi>God.</hi> Soe thou wilt enjoy ſolid peace, and true quiet of mind. Thou maiſt <hi>live</hi> as thou wilt, if thou firſt learneſt what thou art to <hi>deſire.</hi> But thou muſt remember thou art to <hi>deſire</hi> nothing but what <hi>God</hi> willeth. The only felicity we can have in this life is to deſire to doe all our actions according to <hi>Gods</hi> will, and not according to our own.
<hi>God</hi> leads thee to thy <hi>Soveraign</hi> end, for which he had decreed thee from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> through ſorrow and joy, through adverſity &amp; proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Submit thyſelf to his divine <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and cheerfully obey his <hi>will:</hi> for although thou reſiſteſt his
<hi>will,</hi> yet thou wilt be forced to follow it, yet by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance thou makeſt thyſelf guilty of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</hi> Soe true it is, that <hi>God</hi> ſweetly leads thoſe who are willing, but
<hi>draws</hi> them by force who <hi>reſiſt.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Thou maiſt if thou wilt in one <hi>day</hi> arrive to the height of <hi>perfection;</hi> that is, if forſaking the

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 It was an excellent <hi>ſaying</hi> of him who ſaid,
<hi>that thoſe who deſire to profit in vertue, muſt live ſoe, as to be alwaies mending.</hi> For there are many things, which may give
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43202:79"/> hindrance to a <hi>Soul</hi> that is labouring for <hi>vertue.</hi> For example, when thou beareſt an inordinate
<hi>affection</hi> to thyſelf, or to any other <hi>creature:</hi> when thou art ſo tyed to thy <hi>riches,</hi> that if it should happen they should be taken from thee, thou wouldeſt <hi>murmur</hi> very much at it: when thou ſeekeſt too much thy <hi>convenience</hi> in meat, drink, company, and divertiſements: when thou art too much entangled in wordly <hi>affairs,</hi> and followeſt with much obſtinacy thy own will and judgment in all things: when thou doſt not heed, nor give ear to <hi>Gods</hi> inſpirations when he ſpeaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to thy <hi>hart.</hi> Theſe are the cheif
<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments</hi> which hinder thee in the way of <hi>vertue,</hi> which thou muſt endeavor with all care to remove. Whatſoever thou doſt, let
<hi>vertue</hi> accompany thy <hi>action;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou doſt, doe it with promptitude and alacrity, direct it to a <hi>perfect</hi> end; and ſtill remember to have a good intention in all things: and laſtly doe it with ſuch a ſerious application, that the work itſelf may have proportion with the knowledge thou haſt of the end unto which it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.

               <p n="4">4. The dayes fly, time runs away, and no man is able to reſtore what is paſt of it. Thou doſt not live, but art about to live; for ſtill thy life regards <hi>to morrow.</hi> Soe thy <hi>life</hi> eſcapes from thee, whilſt thou art buſy in ſeeking how to
<hi>live:</hi> in the mean time <hi>old</hi> age comes upon thee,
<hi>death</hi> follows, and ſeazes upon thee yet unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As

Why therefore doſt thou delay? Learn how pretious Time is, and how to make uſe of it with all ſpeed: this day, this hour is <hi>pretious,</hi> and if thou looſeſt it, the <hi>loſſe</hi> is irrecoverble. Thou art carefull enough nor to let thy <hi>lands</hi> be invaded by others; and if the leaſt diſpute happens concerning their <hi>limits,</hi> thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently flyeſt to <hi>arms</hi> or <hi>law-ſuits</hi> to defend thy <hi>Right:</hi> but as for thy <hi>Time,</hi> thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt any man to <hi>rob</hi> thee of it; being
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43202:80"/> lavish and prodigall of that, which of all things thou shouldeſt endeavor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with moſt avarice. Reckon thy

<hi>years</hi> as thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt. For how much of this <hi>Time</hi> haſt thou ſpent in ſleeping, feaſting, wrangling, and in converſing with thy
<hi>friends?</hi> Adde all thoſe <hi>hours</hi> ſpent in doing nothing, which paſſe away unawares to thee: by conſidering this, thou wilt underſtand how little <hi>Time</hi> in thy whole life is properly thine, and thou wilt confeſſe thou <hi>dyeſt</hi> very ſoon. Thou often complaineſt of having loſt many <hi>dayes:</hi> why then doſt thou not endeavor to make ſuch uſe of preſent <hi>Time,</hi> that when it is gone thou maiſt ſay, I doe not ſee how I could have employed it better?

                  <hi>ſpeak</hi> of others: that is,
<hi>ſpeak</hi> ill of thy ſelf to thyſelf. Mark and ſpeak of thy own faults, and reprehend all thou findeſt amiſſe in thyſelf. Thou wilt never want <hi>faults</hi> to correct. Retire thyſelf from the

Tis a poor ambition to boaſt of thy <hi>ſolitude.</hi> But remember to joyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>ſolitude</hi> to thy outward retreat, thereby to make profit of it, and render it ſweet and eaſy. Withdraw thyſelf from all vain

The <hi>laws</hi> are not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for he who thinks he can buy of his ſins with bribing, fears nothing. The <hi>Tongues</hi> of <hi>Detractors</hi> are full of bitternes, and there is nothing but deceit in the words of <hi>flatterers.</hi> Thoſe are full of <hi>hatred,</hi> theſe full of <hi>lying.</hi> Some are given to
<hi>drunkenes,</hi> others to ſpend their time <hi>idlely.</hi> Some are inſatiable in their <hi>Avarice,</hi> others ſtill ambitious of
<hi>praiſe</hi> and eſteem. Conſider &amp; look upon the publike

And how is it poſſible thou canſt ſtand firm, or be

<hi>innocent</hi> in the midſt of innumerous <hi>ſinners:</hi> For if they cannot <hi>change</hi> thee, they will at leaſt <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> thee very much. The only way to be <hi>ſecure</hi> is to withdraw thyſelf from ſo many evills, and to put thyſelf in ſuch a quiet condition as to be able to look upon all the <hi>diſorders</hi> of the world without fear of being infected thyſelf with them. He hath an <hi>invincible</hi> ſpirit, who hath bid <hi>adieu</hi> to all wordly things, and can live within himſelf as in a ſtrong <hi>caſtle</hi> well guarded againſt all <hi>enemies:</hi> To ſuch a man the <hi>world</hi> ſeems a priſon, and <hi>ſolitude</hi> a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Tis no great matter to have quitted the company of men, unles thou art at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to thyſelf, and to the practiſe of
<hi>vertue.</hi> There can be no good, where <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> is wanting: no quiet, no happines unles it proceed from <hi>vertue.</hi> There are
<hi>three</hi> things which correſpond with one another in the whole

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43202:84"/> ſenſible things <hi>light,</hi> and amongſt the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the mind <hi>Vertue. God</hi> is the
<hi>light</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of all things: <hi>light</hi> is the
<hi>Vertue</hi> of the world and the image of <hi>God: Vertue,</hi> is the
<hi>light</hi> of the mind, through which we are named &amp; become the children of <hi>God.</hi> Thou muſt approach it with a clean hart and purifyed mind, if thou deſireſt to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the height of
<hi>perfection.</hi> For <hi>vertue</hi> is the perfection of man, reſtoreth inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, &amp; is full of all ſpirituall ſweetnes. It ſupplyeth the defect of <hi>nature,</hi> which of itſelf is not capable of
<hi>ſupernaturall</hi> felicity. It conſiſteth in a facility to doe
<hi>good,</hi> by means of which we live as we ought, are enlightned in our
<hi>underſtanding,</hi> reſiſt ſin, and merit eternall life. In purſuance of this, thou muſt firſt learn the nature and acts of thoſe
<hi>vertues</hi> thou pretendeſt unto, becauſe no man loves, what he doth not underſtand. Then, when thou haſt once begun, endeavor not to intermit or ceaſe from the <hi>practiſe</hi> of it: although occaſion should be wanting, we muſt imitate <hi>ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> who in the midſt of
<hi>Peace</hi> are ſtill exerciſing themſelves, and by <hi>fighting</hi> with one another only in jeſt, prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for reall
<hi>combats.</hi> Imagine thou were accuſed of the greateſt
<hi>crimes,</hi> fancy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43202:84"/> thyſelf calumniated, or that all thy
<hi>riches</hi> were ſuddenly taken away from thee; and by this mean thou maiſt exerciſe thy <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> as much as if ſuch things were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoe. Thou wilt not be diſmayed when the thing happens, if thou canſt thus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thyſelf before it comes. He that hath bine often wounded in the <hi>war,</hi> fights with a good <hi>courage</hi> when the
<hi>battle</hi> comes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The habits of <hi>Vertue</hi> are not got but by long exerciſe. To know if thou haſt learnt any <hi>vertue,</hi> take theſe marks. To wit, if thou findeſt that the <hi>vices</hi> which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the <hi>vertue</hi> thou deſireſt to practiſe are quite extinguished in thee, or at leaſt very much ſuppreſſed. If thou haſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the
<hi>motions</hi> of evill affections, and brought them to obey
<hi>reaſon.</hi> If thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not only facility, but alſo an inward delight in the practiſe of <hi>vertue.</hi> If thou canſt contemn the murmurs &amp; reproaches of tepid ſpirits, and uſe a full <hi>liberty</hi> of will in the exerciſe of thoſe <hi>vertues,</hi> which diſpleaſe ſuch imperfect <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> If thou beginneſt to deteſt and abhor thoſe evill <hi>practiſes,</hi> unto which formerly thou hadſt a ſtrong inclination. If thou art afraid even in ſleep to conſent to or take delight
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43202:85"/> in any <hi>dishoneſt</hi> action, or to approve any <hi>unjuſt</hi> proceeding. If thou ſtriueſt to
<hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> what thou praiſeſt and admireſt in others; and
<hi>abſtaineſt</hi> from thoſe things which thou reprehendeſt in them. If thou eſteemeſt no <hi>fault</hi> little, but art carefull to avoid all ſort of imperfections, however ſoe little. If, when thou ſeeſt &amp; heareſt that thoſe who are no better than thyſelf abound in
<hi>riches</hi> and are raiſed to great <hi>honours,</hi> thou canſt look upon them without envy or emulation. If thou haſt no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to acknowledge thy <hi>faults,</hi> deſiring that all men would reprehend &amp; correct thee. If content with the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of thy own conſcience, thou hideſt and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thy good <hi>works.</hi> For <hi>vertue</hi> is a reward to itſelf, and deſires no other <hi>recompenſe</hi> for doing well but the ſatisfaction of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done it.

Beleeue then and doe good <hi>works</hi> withall, becauſe <hi>Faith</hi> without good works is but a dead <hi>faith.</hi> In thy ſpeech &amp; profeſſion thou endeavoreſt to paſſe for a faithfull
<hi>Believer:</hi> take heed thy life and manners doe not ſpeak thee an
<hi>Infidell.</hi> Thou beleeveſt the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> why then doſt thou not obey it? Thou beleeveſt there is a life <hi>everlaſting;</hi> why then doſt thou prefer
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43202:86"/> a short time in this world before

<hi>Truth</hi> and goodnes, if thou art falſe thyſelf and workeſt

               <p n="2">2. Since it is certain that all things are diſpoſed and governed by the providence of <hi>God,</hi> ſo as not ſo much as a

Know that all human <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells</hi> are deceitfull and uncertain; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou oughteſt to permit thyſelf to be wholly guided and governed by <hi>God</hi> without the leaſt trouble or anxiety. And though ſome unexpected
<hi>misfortune</hi> should happen, which may ſeem to confound &amp; ſpoyl all thy actions and deſigns; whither it be ſicknes, calumnies, falſe accuſations, or ſome other greater afflictions; doe not looſe courage for all this, but confiding in his divine aſſiſtance commit thyſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43202:86"/> to his will: for <hi>God</hi> hath decreed perhaps from all <hi>Eternity</hi> to make theſe chances &amp; afflictions a means for working thy <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He that hath a ſtrong hope of the future joyes and riches of <hi>paradiſe,</hi> doth not feel the preſent
<hi>miſeries</hi> of this life. As much as thou hopeſt &amp; believeſt, ſo much thou maiſt be ſaid to poſſeſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Charity</hi> which is the <hi>Queen</hi> and ſoul of all other <hi>Vertues</hi> regardeth <hi>God</hi> and our neighbour. As for
<hi>God,</hi> we are bound to love him above things with all our <hi>hart,</hi> with all our <hi>Soul,</hi> and with all our <hi>ſtrength:</hi> we muſt love him purely for himſelf, and for the love of his goodnes. That thou art, that thou liveſt, that thou haſt motion and ſenſe, that thou underſtandeſt, all this is the grace and gift of <hi>God.</hi> It is he that hath redeemed thee from the ſlavery of the <hi>Devill:</hi> it is he that hath endowed thy <hi>Soul</hi> with innumerable prerogatives: it is he that hath prepared <hi>life</hi> everlaſting for thee without any preceding merit of thine. The skies, the earth, the ayr, the water, all things contained in them, cry dayly unto thee, that thou art bound to love him above all things, becauſe he is the <hi>Author</hi> of all theſe things and hath created them for thy uſe. Why then doſt thou wander
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43202:87"/> here and there to ſeek thy
<hi>happines</hi> where it is not to be found? Love that one ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign good (to wit <hi>God</hi>) in whom alone is all that is good. Seek that ſoveraign
<hi>Good,</hi> then which nothing is greater, nothing more deſirable. Tis
<hi>Love</hi> alone, that can make us capable to shew our gratitude to
<hi>God;</hi> although it is altogether impoſſible we should requite his
<hi>benefits</hi> with an equall proportion of <hi>Love.</hi> Love is not idle, doth not ſeek its own <hi>intereſts,</hi> it worketh great things, when it is great itſelf. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems hard unto <hi>Love.</hi> A true
<hi>lover</hi> may ſuffer <hi>death,</hi> but can never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nature hath made us ſociable, and given us all a mutuall <hi>Love:</hi> for we are all members of one great <hi>Body,</hi> being all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſame glory. He doth not love
<hi>God,</hi> who loveth not his <hi>brother.</hi> The effect of
<hi>charity</hi> to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors is to doe good unto all, to be kind, to be civill, and prevent them with love, and good turns. Doe good unto thoſe who have need of thy help with a cheerfull and willing mind, without delay, unles it be requiſite to deferr it for a while, thereby to favour the bashfulnes of thoſe who are to receive thy <hi>benefits.</hi> Doe not ſtay untill
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43202:87"/> thou art asked when thou once knoweſt the
<hi>neceſsity</hi> of a perſon. It is a hard word, to be obliged to ſay,
<hi>I deſire your aſsiſtance:</hi> If thou preventeſt thy
<hi>friend,</hi> by doing him a curteſy before he asketh it, tis a double good turn. He that hath obtained by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot ſay he had it for nothing. If thou canſt not prevent his <hi>asking,</hi> at leaſt let him not <hi>ask</hi> long; but grant him what he <hi>asketh</hi> with ſuch a readines, that he may think thou wert ready to aſſiſt him without being
<hi>asked.</hi> Then, together with the good turn thou doſt him, give him alſo good words; and let no ſadnes, ſlownes, upbraiding, or boaſting be mixed with thy <hi>Curteſy.</hi> The matter will ſpeak for it ſelf, although thou ſayeſt nothing in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it: <hi>God</hi> who ſeeth thy moſt hidden thoughts, will reward thee for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Amongſt all the acts of <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> we may give the firſt place to <hi>Alms-giving,</hi> by which our
<hi>faith</hi> is shewn, our <hi>ſins</hi> are redeemed, <hi>heaven</hi> is bought. Take heed then, thou doſt not contemn the <hi>poor,</hi> who although he is in want himſelf, yet is able to make thee <hi>rich</hi> in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi> Thou art ſold to the <hi>devill</hi> by thy <hi>ſins,</hi> redeem thyſelf with thy <hi>mony:</hi> and change the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of

Thou payeſt taxe and contribution to a <hi>Prince,</hi> and that unwillingly, although thou haſt received no advantagious crop from thy harveſt; and canſt thou deny to give a ſmall <hi>alms</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> out of the abundance of thy ſtock? Take heed leaſt by ſparing thy <hi>mony,</hi> thou becomeſt guilty of thy <hi>brothers</hi> death. Thou haſt killed him perhaps, by not feeding him in his want. Thou takeſt great care how thy
<hi>Heirs</hi> may live at their eaſe after thee, but thou takeſt no care to make a happy end thyſelf. It is better thy <hi>heirs</hi> should want ſomething of that full <hi>Eſtate</hi> which thou intendeſt to leave them, rather then thou shouldeſt hazard thy <hi>Salvation</hi> to enrich them.

               <p n="1">1. AS it is impoſſible for an <hi>Architect</hi> to make his work juſt and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of his <hi>Rule</hi> and
<hi>Plummer,</hi> ſo we can never doe our actions aright without
<hi>Prudence.</hi> This is the <hi>Guide</hi> of all other <hi>vertues,</hi> by this things are done in due order: tis the <hi>eye</hi> of our <hi>Soul,</hi> and the <hi>art</hi> of well doing. No man can lead a contented life without
<hi>prudence.</hi> And yet tis the moſt difficile and moſt obſcure of all
<hi>arts</hi> to learn. The difficulty proceedeth from its comprehending and conſidering all manner of things as well general as particular. Beſides, whereas the things of this world are ſubject to continuall <hi>change,</hi> and depend on ſeverall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; it is not in every mans capacity to reduce them to a certain <hi>rule,</hi> or to joyn, temper, and reconcile things which are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43202:89"/> many times quite oppoſite and contrary. As for the obſcurity unto which it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the cauſe ſeems to be in a certain <hi>darknes</hi> wherein the ſeverall cauſes of things are involved. We ſee as it were the top of our affairs, but we know not where their foundation is hidden. Moreover, the proſperous or unhappy event of things depends on the eternall decree of <hi>God;</hi> which is another cauſe that true <hi>prudence</hi> is rarely found. Very few, and perhaps not one man in the whole world, can alwaies foreſee what is moſt expedient in every matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Prudence</hi> is got by uſe, memory, and experience. Particular things which are governed by <hi>prudence,</hi> are known unto man by uſe and experience. Thou wilt ever be ſafe, if thou wilt believe thy own and others <hi>experience,</hi> and never undertake any thing, which may give thee reaſon to fear, or put thee in danger to fall. But that thou maiſt diſpoſe all things with <hi>prudence,</hi> firſt look unto thyſelf, then conſider the <hi>buſines</hi> thou art going about, and laſtly the <hi>perſons</hi> for whoſe ſake, or with whom thou art to deal. Examine well thy own ability, leaſt that thou maiſt ſeem to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able to doe more then really thou
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43202:89"/> canſt. One falls by truſting to and relying too much on his own <hi>eloquence;</hi> another offends againſt
<hi>prudence</hi> by undertaking more then his <hi>Eſtate</hi> is able to bear a third indiſcreetly oppreſſeth his infirm <hi>body</hi> by ſome laborious <hi>office.</hi> Conſider what thou undertakeſt, and compare thy forces to thy deſigns. He that will goe about to carry more then he is well able to bear, will fall under the <hi>burden.</hi> Undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then, unles thou knoweſt or hopeſt at leaſt thou shalt bring it to a good end. Chooſe ſuch <hi>perſons</hi> to deal withall, which thou thinkeſt are worthy of thy <hi>friendship,</hi> and deſerve that thou shouldeſt employ part of thy life in their ſervice: ſtudy their nature and manners, that thou maiſt not endammage thyſelf, by ſeeking to profit others. In fine, thou oughteſt to conſider, whither thy nature be proper for ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and endeavor ſtill to apply it to thoſe things which thou haſt a naturall inclination to. Tis but loſt <hi>labour</hi> to ſtrive againſt nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A wiſe and <hi>prudent</hi> man undertaketh nothing, as long as his <hi>thoughts</hi> are any way troubled: for a troubled mind, that is deluded with the <hi>fancies</hi> of ſome inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſion, cannot diſcern Truth and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43202:90"/> honeſty from their <hi>Contraries. Precipitation</hi> alſo is very much contrary to <hi>prudence,</hi> and leadeth many into great and inextricable troubles. Wherefore a <hi>prudent</hi> man doth nothing rashly, but ſubmitteth his own judgment to the counſell of a <hi>friend.</hi> Mens thoughts are full of fear, their forecaſts very uncertain, the event of things alwaies dubious, experiences deceitfull. Where many adviſe, there is moſt certainty. It concerneth alſo a
<hi>prudent</hi> man to conſider things in themſelves, and to look upon them deveſted of all painting and diſguiſe, which are wont to deceive the unwary. Lay aſide the conſideration of money, fame &amp; dignity. Search the matter in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ask what it is, and not what it is called. Tis a great
<hi>folly</hi> to permit ourſelves to be deceived with <hi>figures</hi> and shadows. Then look upon the whole buſines, and behold all that can happen, as out of a high <hi>watch-Tower,</hi> that thou maiſt not be forced to ſay in the end like a foolish man, <hi>I did not think this would happen.</hi> To this purpoſe thou haſt need of long conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mature judgment, and a ſtrict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, leaſt that ſome bad <hi>circumſtance</hi> should ſpoyl the action, leaſt that <hi>prudence</hi> should degenerate into
<hi>craft,</hi> and in fine,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43202:90"/> leaſt that (true and apparent good having ſo much ſimilitude) thou shouldſt embrace <hi>vice</hi> for vertue. Having thus at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon the <hi>election</hi> of what thou art to doe, break of all delay, and preſently put in execution what thou haſt reſolved. No <hi>delay</hi> is to be admitted where good <hi>Counſell</hi> is once taken; which cannot be praiſed, untill it is put in effect.</p>

This is the <hi>vertue</hi> which keepeth men from mutuall <hi>injuries,</hi> and keeps the whole world in <hi>peace.</hi> It is this which makes a ſecret agreement of all things in nature, and is the <hi>bond</hi> of all human ſociety: and nothing can be right without it. The <hi>juſt</hi> man offendeth no body, challengeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not his own, does good to all, thinks and ſpeaks well of all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43202:91"/> gives every one his own, &amp; never hinders the good of another. If he is in <hi>Authority,</hi> he commands what is <hi>juſt,</hi> he deals openly, and preferreth the <hi>good</hi> of thoſe who are under him before his own private <hi>Intereſt:</hi> he punisheth <hi>vice,</hi> rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>vertue,</hi> and ſo keeps all in good order. If he is ſubject to others, he is quiet and peaceable, obeyes the

<hi>dignity</hi> or office; neither doth he intrude himſelf into affairs which doe not concern him. He exerciſeth Juſtice <hi>gratis,</hi> becauſe he knows there can be no greater reward of <hi>juſt</hi> actions, then to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to shew ourſelves <hi>juſt.</hi>

<hi>vertues</hi> which can be practiſed in this life, regardeth <hi>God</hi> immediately in himſelf, as he deſerves to be worshiped and hounoured. The firſt <hi>worship</hi> we owe him, is to believe in him, and to know him: and next to adore his <hi>majeſty,</hi> and admire his <hi>goodnes.</hi> It avayleth little to know <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>Devills</hi> who hate him, know him as well as <hi>men:</hi> he exacteth our <hi>Love</hi> and worship, which conſiſt of things which are better known then practiſed.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43202:91"/> Thou knoweſt he is that <hi>God</hi> who gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the world, hath care of all human kind, moderateth all things: thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeſt he is all power, all goodnes, all majeſty: and thou hopeſt to find eternall <hi>Beatitude</hi> in him, as thy ſoveraign

All thy <hi>Religion</hi> is vain, unles thou sheweſt it by thy <hi>actions.</hi> Doſt thou deſire to be truly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious?</hi> walk in the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and thou wilt be perfect. He may be truly ſaid to worſhip <hi>God,</hi> who imitateth his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</hi> True <hi>religion</hi> tyeth thee to

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Penance</hi> is vertue by which we make reparation of honour to <hi>Gods</hi> law which we had transgreſſed: by this we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to deteſt and expiate all our <hi>ſins,</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:43202:92"/> and to make reſolution of never conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them again.

               <p n="4">4. Our life is divided into <hi>three</hi> ſorts of Times: preſent, paſt, and future.

Doe not fear thy memory will fayl thee, nor be not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to look back on thy life paſt, nor to reproach to thyſelf thy own <hi>errors.</hi> The oftner thou doſt this, the ſooner thou wilt mend. Reſolve to be revenged on thyſelf, and never to commit thoſe
<hi>faults</hi> which now thou art ſorry to have once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

               <p n="1">1. NO tongue is able to expreſſe and ſufficiently to extoll the praiſes of a man who can truly ſay: I have alwaies obeyed my

<hi>turns.</hi> Theſe are the duties of <hi>Piety,</hi> which we owe and ought to pay to our countrey, friends, and relations. But as we are to pay theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43202:93"/> of <hi>Piety</hi> to our <hi>friends,</hi> ſo likewiſe we are to pay due reſpect to all our <hi>Superiors, Princes, maſters,</hi> and others, who are any way above us in dignity, wiſedome, age, religion, and piety. For it is the cuſtome to riſe and ſtand in their preſence <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,</hi> to give them <hi>way,</hi> to light from horſe-back or to come out of the <hi>Coach</hi> when we meet them, to
<hi>kneel</hi> at their feet, to <hi>kiſſe</hi> their hands or garments, &amp; to shew them other ſigns of our <hi>reſpect,</hi> according to the fashions of the <hi>countrey</hi> we are in. And thou wilt find no difficulty to give them their due in this point, if firſt thou haſt conceived a high eſteem of their <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> For by this means there will ariſe in thy <hi>will</hi> a certain care and fear, which will make thee avoid all familiarity with them, and by conſidering their <hi>greatnes</hi> acknowledge thy own <hi>littlenes.</hi> All <hi>power</hi> is from <hi>God:</hi> and conſequently all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect thou giveſt to thy
<hi>betters,</hi> is ſtill leſſe then what thou oweſt them, that is, if thou conſidereſt <hi>God</hi> in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As all miſery had its beginning from the
<hi>diſobedience</hi> of our firſts <hi>parents,</hi> ſo we haue bine put again in a capacity of being happy by the <hi>obedience</hi> of the
<hi>ſon</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> provided we alſo keep our <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:43202:94"/> and our Superiors. <hi>Obedience</hi> is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all things, and ſtrongeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which they have with their firſt beginning. For it deriveth all things from <hi>God,</hi> and referreth all to him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended this <hi>vertue</hi> in particular, and choſe rather to looſe his <hi>life</hi> then to looſe his
<hi>obedience. Obedience is better then ſacrifice,</hi> becauſe thereby a man <hi>ſacrifyes</hi> his own will. We muſt receive the command of
<hi>ſuperiors</hi> as a voice coming from heaven, without examining the cauſe and motive of ſuch <hi>commands.</hi> He that hath learned perfect
<hi>obedience,</hi> will not ſtand to give his own judgment of the thing
<hi>commanded.</hi> When my <hi>ſuperiour</hi> admonisheth me, when the
<hi>law</hi> commands me, and tells me what I am to doe, I muſt not diſpute or excuſe the buſines, but <hi>obey</hi> with promptitude &amp; ſimplicity; shewing myſelf equally ready to perform all things, great or ſmall, eaſy or hard. There is only one <hi>caſe,</hi> wherein thou maiſt be obſtinate and refuſe to <hi>obey;</hi> that is, if any one goes about to draw thee from <hi>vertue</hi> or force thee to doe any thing againſt <hi>Gods</hi> law. As for any thing elſe which is commanded thee, thou art to obey readily and without all murmuring.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Gratitude</hi> conſiſteth in acknowledging
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43202:94"/> ourſelves oblig'd for ſome
<hi>curteſy</hi> received. Our cheif care muſt be to have a true eſteem of the <hi>benefit</hi> which is done us, in which we should not ſo much regard the greatnes of the <hi>gift</hi> itſelf, as the greatnes of his good
<hi>will</hi> who giveth it. And we ought to have ſuch continuall memory of good <hi>deeds</hi> which are done us, as never to forget them. He cannot be thankfull for a <hi>curteſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who ſoon forgets it: and he that ſtill remembers it, may be eſteemed to have already requited it. There needs no great riches, nor labour, nor proſperity, to shew ourſelves
<hi>gratefull.</hi> Tis alwaies in our power. If thou wanteſt means and ſtrength, thou canſt not want a <hi>will,</hi> in which thou art able to repay <hi>Kings.</hi> When thou receiveſt a <hi>curteſy</hi> from any one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it cheerfully, and in ſuch a manner, that he who obliges thee may ſee his <hi>curteſy</hi> is well beſtowed. He hath good reaſon to rejoyce that ſees his <hi>friend</hi> merry and light-hearted, but his joy encreaſes when he conſiders that he is the cauſe of his <hi>friends</hi> joy. He that receives a benefit with <hi>gratitude,</hi> &amp; with a kind acceptance, may be ſaid to repay the firſt penſion of it. He hath no intention to be <hi>gratefull,</hi> who throws (as we may ſay) all
<hi>curteſies</hi> ſo far
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43202:95"/> out of his memory that they ſeem quite out of ſight. He that extolleth the <hi>good</hi> which is done him, and confeſſeth his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to requite it, hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited it. He that receives a <hi>curteſy</hi> with a proud or negligent carriage, ſeems to make no account of the <hi>gift.</hi> He that is cold in returning
<hi>thanks,</hi> and ſcarce moves his <hi>lips</hi> to acknowledge the obligation, is more <hi>ungratefull,</hi> then if he ſaid nothing. An honeſt man at the very time he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a <hi>curteſy</hi> is thinking how to requite it. For what is more contrary to civility, then not to return what thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? and when we return a <hi>curteſy,</hi> we should endeavor to doe rather more then leſſe, as good <hi>ground</hi> is wont to yeild a double encreaſe of the <hi>ſeed</hi> it hath received. Notwiſtanding take heed thou doſt not make too much haſt in returning
<hi>thanks.</hi> Some are of that nature, that when any little preſent is ſent them, they preſently ſend another to the ſame <hi>perſon,</hi> as if they would reſtify they <hi>owe</hi> him nothing This is a kind of refuſing to accept a <hi>curteſy,</hi> when thou blotteſt out one

<hi>Chriſtian</hi> to have a lying Tongue. Tis a weak, vulgar, and womanish imperfection, to ſpeak one thing and think another. An honeſt generous ſpirit ſpeaks things as they are, doth not exaggerate, or amplify them, doth not deceive, doth not diſſemble, doth not uſe ambiguous words.
<hi>Truth</hi> which is ſimple in itſelf, loveth <hi>ſimple</hi> expreſſions. It hates all diſguiſe, becauſe it is innocent.

In which we ought to admire the providence of <hi>God,</hi> which hath planted in our minds a naturall inclination to thoſe <hi>vertues,</hi> which are neceſſary to maintain human <hi>ſociety:</hi> And <hi>lying</hi> is the moſt prejudiciall to this. For if thou deteſteſt all falſity of ſpeech as unworthy of a generous mind, why doſt thou permit thyſelf and thy whole life to be nothing elſe but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <hi>cheat?</hi> It it is a great matter to deal plainly, and not to have a double <hi>hart.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. NOthing is more neceſſary in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety then
<hi>Friendship,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more commodious, nothing more ſweet. It conſiſteth in a mutuall <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> (grounded upon
<hi>vertue</hi>) betwixt two perſons, and in a mutuall communication of each others <hi>felicity.</hi> How happy wilt thou be, if thou canſt find a
<hi>friend</hi> to whoſe breſt thou maiſt ſafely commit thy moſt
<hi>ſecret</hi> thoughts, whoſe <hi>conſcience</hi> thou maiſt truſt as much as thy own; whoſe <hi>ſpeech</hi> may comfort thee in thy afflictions, whoſe <hi>advice</hi> may help thee in thy affairs, whoſe merry diſpoſition may diſpell thy <hi>ſorrows,</hi> whoſe only ſight may recreate thee? what is more ſweet then to have a man, unto whom thou haſt no difficulty to confeſſe any <hi>fault</hi> thou haſt committed? As we doe not perceive that we are bit by certain little
<hi>beaſts,</hi> untill we ſee the ſwelling: ſo in converſing with a good <hi>friend,</hi> thou wilt
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:43202:98"/> not perhaps perceive when and how he does thee <hi>good,</hi> yet thou wilt find at laſt that thou haſt profited by his converſation. If there is not a mutuall <hi>love,</hi> there can be no true <hi>friendship;</hi> but tis more noble to <hi>love,</hi> then to be
<hi>loved;</hi> and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence is the main ground of
<hi>friendship,</hi> and reciprocall <hi>love</hi> is but an addition to it. Beſides that is to be counted true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friendship,</hi> which is begun not for any temporall <hi>intereſt,</hi> but for the intereſt of
<hi>God;</hi> which is entertained not by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall preſence, vain ſervices, or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flattery, but by a mutuall aſſiſtance in the ſtudy of holy things. There can be no ſolid <hi>friendship,</hi> if grounded on evill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Great <hi>caution</hi> is to be uſed in chooſing a friend, according to the common ſaying: That we muſt eat many bushells of ſalt together, before we make a perfect <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> with any man.
<hi>Four</hi> things are to be tryed in one, whom thou deſireſt to chooſe for thy <hi>friend.</hi> Firſt his <hi>Fidelity,</hi> a thing which is very rare in this world, that thou maiſt ſafely truſt him with thy perſon and moſt ſecret affairs. Secondly, his <hi>Intention,</hi> that friendship may have a lawfull end, &amp; leaſt that a holy thing be changed into ſome shamefull <hi>commerce.</hi> Thirdly his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:43202:98"/> that thou maiſt know what to ask of him, and what ſervices thou art to render him. Fourthly his <hi>Patience,</hi> that thou maiſt know whither or no he will be willing to undergoe any hazard or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity for his <hi>friend.</hi> When thou haſt tryed all theſe things in him, inform thyſelf alſo, how he hath behaved himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly towards other <hi>friends:</hi> for thou maiſt expect he will prove the ſame to thee as he was to others. A true <hi>friend</hi> is a living
<hi>Treaſure,</hi> and therefore to be kept with great care, and to be lamented (if loſt) with great ſorrow. Thou art happy, if thou haſt a
<hi>friend</hi> who loveth thee, and not thy riches, table, or wit: who will correct thee committing any faults, who will help thee to riſe and amend when thou falleſt, who will comfort &amp; exhort thee in the purſuit of
<hi>Vertue.</hi> Thou wilt not find another like him in the whole world. There are many who bear the name of <hi>Friends,</hi> but few are really ſoe. No man loves another <hi>gratis,</hi> and for nothing. He that regards his own
<hi>intereſt,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth temporall things for the end of his
<hi>friendship,</hi> is no true <hi>friend.</hi> He will love thee as long, as he finds his profit in thy <hi>friendship.</hi> If thy fortune chance to decay,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43202:99"/> he falleth of; &amp; he will end, as he began. True <hi>friendship</hi> is leaſt found, where it ſeems to abound moſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As a <hi>Phiſitian</hi> that goes about to cure a ſick <hi>friend,</hi> ſpares neither cutting nor bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſoe thou oughteſt to behave thyſelf towards thy <hi>friend</hi> who needs thy corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: reprehend him freely, boldly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, neglecting nothing, diſſembling nothing. It is a poor way of obliging a <hi>friend,</hi> to foment his <hi>vices.</hi> Yet let thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition be ſecret, with all ſweetnes, and without mixing the leaſt bitternes in words. Take time to deliberate before thou admitteſt any man into thy <hi>friendship:</hi> but when thou haſt reſolv'd to admit him, receive him with a ſincere hart: ſpeak as freely unto him, as to thyſelf. Thou shouldeſt live ſoe, as to doe and ſpeak nothing, which thou art afraid should be known even to thy
<hi>enemyes:</hi> but in regard <hi>cuſtome</hi> hath ſo prevailed, that many things are eſteemed neceſſary to be concealed according to prudence, at leaſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all thy cares, all thy thoughts with thy
<hi>friend.</hi> Some are ſo indiſcreet as to tell every one they meet what they should commit only unto <hi>friends:</hi> others are ſoe
<hi>timorous</hi> as they dare not truſt their deareſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43202:99"/> 
                  <hi>friends,</hi> and foe keep all their
<hi>ſecrets</hi> within their own breſt, and would not truſt themſelves if they could help it. Tis equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>faulty,</hi> to believe all men, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve no body: the one ſeems to carry more <hi>Civility,</hi> the other more <hi>ſafety.</hi> But if thou deſireſt to converſe with all men without danger, thou maiſt eaſily doe it, not by <hi>hiding</hi> what thou doſt, but by doing nothing which thou deſireſt should be
<hi>ſecret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Affability</hi> hath great affinity with
<hi>friendship;</hi> for it moderates human <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> in which we ought to keep a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>modeſty</hi> and ſilence. A vertuous man should <hi>hear</hi> much and <hi>ſpeak</hi> little. Tis a great fault to be more deſirous to be known, then to know: no make ourſelves known, then to know others: to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall in ſpending our own <hi>wit</hi> and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to no purpoſe, rather then learn <hi>wit</hi> from others. Thou muſt accuſtome thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bear with the <hi>rude</hi> language and manners of thoſe with whom thou liveſt: and becauſe many ſpeak things which are perhaps falſe, childish and impertinent, it is thy part to diſſemble at all this with <hi>prudence.</hi> Tis the mark of an abject and effeminate mind, to deſire to converſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43202:100"/> with none but thoſe who thoſe
<hi>applaud</hi> and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee. Speak leſſe of thyſelf and thy own affairs; be not obſtinate in thy own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and abſtain from all haughty words, which ſound as if thou didſt intend to shew thy <hi>authority</hi> over others. When thou ſeeſt any thing done amiſſe, enter into thyſelf and examine thy <hi>conſcience,</hi> to ſee if thou art not guilty of the ſame <hi>vice:</hi> and whatſoever thou heareſt or ſeeſt, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to make thy profit of it. Things goe well with thee, if thou learneſt to amend thy own <hi>faults</hi> by ſeeing the
<hi>defail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances</hi> of others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When thou meeteſt with any ſtrange, ſudden, and unexpected thing, &amp; which is contrary to the cuſtome and fashion of thy
<hi>countrey,</hi> doe not preſently condemn it: for it is a ſign of great lightnes to wonder and laugh at the <hi>cuſtomes</hi> of other
<hi>nations,</hi> and be a ſlave to the <hi>fashions</hi> of ones own
<hi>countrey.</hi> We muſt eſteem things as they are, and not as they ſeem to be. The <hi>common</hi> people judge of all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the novelty, art, rarity, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, pomp, rumor, and outward shew. But a
<hi>wiſe</hi> man looks upon the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall value and grace, and contemneth all that which the foolish and mad <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:43202:100"/> admires. Whatſoever happens, it is in thy power to make thy profit of it. Doe not leſſen thy <hi>fortune</hi> nor diminish thy <hi>rents.</hi> It is permitted thee to imitate

<hi>magnificent</hi> works, we mean ſuch as belong to the honour of

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43202:103"/> niether threatning nor entreating can withdraw him from <hi>vertue:</hi> he is not diſcouraged, although he finds many <hi>obſtacles</hi> in his affairs: he doth not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his burden, nor ſeek to shake of what he hath once undertaken; but he continues firm, untill he hath brought it to a good end; no burden can make him shrink: no force, no power, no fear can make him leſſe: all the dangers in the world cannot make him forbear or hide his <hi>vertue.</hi> He doth not regard what he ſuffers, but ſtill conſiders what he hath deſigned, &amp; what he ayms at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As thoſe who <hi>ſayl</hi> with a good
<hi>wind</hi> doe not forbear to provide againſt a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt:</hi> Soe thou oughteſt, in time of <hi>proſperity</hi> to prepare thyſelf to endure <hi>Adverſity.</hi> Fancy to thyſelf that ſome great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had befallen thee; as loſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, shipwrack, banishment, wounds, torments, ſicknes, calumny, reproaches: and carry thyſelf with that moderation in this <hi>fancy,</hi> as if thoſe things were really befallen thee; that ſoe by this kind of exerciſe thou maiſt be able to ſay on all occaſions. I had long ſince prepared my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt this misfortune, I foreſaw it, and contemned it long ſince. It is decreed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43202:104"/> from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> what thou art to ſuffer, and when thou art to rejoice: and althô every mans life is ſubject to ſeverall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet we all agree in this. As we are
<hi>mortall</hi> ourſelves, ſoe all that we poſſeſſe is ſubject to perish. Why art thou out of patience? What doſt thou complain of? Although all that thou haſt should perish, yet thou looſeſt nothing which is properly thine. It is better to give it willingly, when <hi>God</hi> calls for it, then to ſtay till we are forced to render it. <hi>Epicurus</hi> hath taught us that a <hi>wiſe</hi> man may be <hi>happy</hi> in the midſt of
<hi>torments.</hi> Althô, ſayes he, he should be incloſed in
<hi>Phalaris</hi> his braſen <hi>Bull,</hi> yet he will ſay: How little doe I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to be thus <hi>tormented.</hi> It was generous ſaying, and not incredible unto us <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> amongſt whom are extant the
<hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of ſo many <hi>Martyrs,</hi> whoſe Conſtancy in the midſt of <hi>Tortures,</hi> and alacricy in the midſt of <hi>flames</hi> hath bine ſoe great, that they ſeemed to have no feeling at all of their
<hi>Torments.</hi> To thoſe who love <hi>God</hi> &amp; willingly ſuffer for his cauſe, all <hi>pains</hi> are delights.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The excellency of <hi>Fortitude</hi> never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with more glory, then when we are brought to ſuffer <hi>Death.</hi> It is very hard
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43202:104"/> to contemn <hi>life,</hi> in regard we ſee moſt men eſteem it at ſo great a rate, that they think nothing more pretious. But if thou art <hi>wiſe,</hi> as it behoves thee to be, thou wilt not eſteem <hi>Death</hi> an evill, ſince it is the end of all
<hi>Evils,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>life.</hi> Thou shouldeſt leave thy
<hi>body</hi> with a willing mind, conſidering thou art to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it again in the <hi>laſt</hi> day. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Death</hi> is invincible, and tis meer madnes to fear it: for that which we fear is alwaies dubious, but that which we expect, is certain. Conſider how that <hi>children,</hi> and thoſe who have loſt their <hi>wits,</hi> doe not fear <hi>death.</hi> Is it not a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe then, if <hi>reaſon</hi> cannot give thee the ſame ſecurity which want of <hi>reaſon</hi> gives unto <hi>fools. God</hi> hath given us <hi>life,</hi> but not without a condition of being ſubject to
<hi>dye:</hi> he that is not willing to <hi>dye,</hi> shews that he never deſired to <hi>live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We are obliged to <hi>nature,</hi> for having granted us a certain time to ſee and make uſe of all her <hi>riches</hi> and glory: and now the time being out, we muſt part. What <hi>wiſe</hi> man, when he is brought to the laſt gaſp, would be willing (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to begin his <hi>life</hi> anew, to be firſt shut up in his <hi>mothers</hi> womb, then to paſſe over
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43202:105"/> again all the follyes of his
<hi>infancy,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe again all the fears of his <hi>child-hood,</hi> all the dangers of his <hi>youth,</hi> all the cares of his <hi>man-hood,</hi> all the labours of his <hi>old age?</hi> No man hath lived ſoe happily, as to wiſh to be <hi>born</hi> again. Conſider therefore whither thou art going, and whence thou art parting. But perhaps thou wouldeſt not be afraid to
<hi>dye,</hi> if thou didſt certainly hope to goe to <hi>Heaven.</hi> This is the cauſe of thy <hi>fear,</hi> becauſe thou are void of all
<hi>vertue,</hi> and good workes, and only now beginneſt to be <hi>good</hi> when thou art forced to leave the <hi>world.</hi> Were it not for this, thou wouldeſt not be afraid to <hi>dye,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it is the
<hi>Gate</hi> to eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It would be a torment to a <hi>juſt</hi> man to be <hi>born,</hi> unles <hi>death</hi> were to follow.</p>
               <p n="5">5. No man <hi>dyeth</hi> with joy, unles he hath long prepared for it before hand. Render it familiar to thy thoughts by a continuall
<hi>meditation</hi> of it, that ſoe thou maiſt receive it when it comes, with a joyfull hart. A man is not ſaid to have lived enough, for having lived many dayes, or many years, but for having a mind that deſires to leave the world, &amp; to fly to its <hi>Origine.</hi> He hath <hi>lived</hi> long enough who <hi>dyes</hi> well: and he <hi>dyes</hi> well, who
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43202:105"/> hath <hi>lived</hi> well. Doſt thou deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thyſelf a quiet <hi>death?</hi> Accuſtome thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt to contemn all temporall things. He cannot fear <hi>death,</hi> who hath already deprived himſelf of more then <hi>death</hi> can take away from him. Doſt thou deſire to lead a pleaſant life? Clear thy mind of all un-neceſſary care concerning it: be ready for all ſort of <hi>death:</hi> and doe not concern thyſelf, whither thou art to <hi>dye</hi> by the
<hi>ſword,</hi> or by the violence of a <hi>feavor:</hi> Live foe, that thou maiſt dayly ſay: <hi>I have lived.</hi> He liveth in ſecurity, and dyes with joy, who dayly fancies himſelf carried to his <hi>grave,</hi> and who is permitted to <hi>live</hi> after he was content to <hi>dye.</hi> It is impoſſible thou shouldeſt <hi>live</hi> well, unles thou <hi>dyeſt</hi> every day.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe very name of <hi>magnanimity</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates ſome great matter; it is a high <hi>vertue,</hi> of great force, and alwaies tending to <hi>great</hi> things. Without this all other <hi>vertues</hi> would droop and languish. For whereas there occur many difficulties in the practice of
<hi>vertue, magnanimity</hi> reſiſts all and ouercomes all: and never shrinketh, untill having paſt all difficulties, it hath generouſly arrived unto what it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bring to effect. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of
<hi>magnanimity,</hi> to wit, to incline us at all times to great and
<hi>heroicall</hi> actions, and with the help of <hi>Gods</hi> grace to make us undertake the moſt difficile labours with a ſecure and ready mind. Thou muſt reſolve to be <hi>bold</hi> and couragious if thou intendeſt to come to any thing. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to perform great matters without great pains. Man is able to doe much, when he reſolves to doe like a <hi>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:43202:106"/>2. A man of a great ſpirit alwaies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires to great things, and contemneth all thoſe things as little, which the <hi>vulgar</hi> eſteemeth great. He does things, which are worthy of much honour; but is not ſorry when this honour is not paid, and contemneth it when offered, unles <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> or <hi>Gods</hi> honour requires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He does nothing for <hi>oſtentation,</hi> but all for conſcience ſake, and ſeeketh a reward for doing well not in the mouth of the world, but from the work itſelf. He ſtands alwaies firm, is invincible, above all bad fortune, and ſtill equall to himſelf upon all occaſions: and doth not ſtrive to aſcend to higher dignities, but is content with his own
<hi>greatnes.</hi> He is above all things, and therefore is a <hi>Slave</hi> to no body, begs and entreats nothing of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanteth nothing of all that is without him. Nothing can frighten or make him yield. Sometimes he makes shew of his generous nature, but then tis not out of any vain glory; for he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the <hi>degree</hi> he is in, &amp; the <hi>gifts</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath given him. But he alwaies joyns unto this a firm and profound <hi>humility</hi> in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe he refers all his glory and all the gifts of nature and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43202:107"/> which he poſſeſſeth unto him alone; holding for certain that of himſelf he hath nothing, can doe nothing, and is really nothing. This is to know the true limits of <hi>vertue,</hi> alwaies to have an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of our ſelves and all our actions; and yet not to refuſe thoſe <hi>honours</hi> which are due unto ſuch actions, when we may accept them without breaking the rules of <hi>modeſty.</hi> We muſt not purſue <hi>honours,</hi> but permit them to follow us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that hath this vertue of <hi>magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> receaveth all the blows of adverſe <hi>fortune</hi> with an undaunted
<hi>hart,</hi> that he may attain to the height of perfection. When he meets with <hi>inferiour</hi> perſons, he can ſtill carry himſelf towards them with a certain moderation; and when he meets with <hi>Princes</hi> or ſome other powerfull and wealthy perſons, he doth not caſt himſelf at their
<hi>feet</hi> in a flattering manner, nor will he permit his liberty to be oppreſſed with their <hi>tyrannous</hi> power. Thoſe things which are worthy of <hi>hatred,</hi> he hateth <hi>openly;</hi> and thoſe things which are worthy of <hi>Love,</hi> he loveth them after the ſame manner. And thoſe things which ought to be done and ſpoken <hi>openly,</hi> he does and ſpeaks them <hi>openly;</hi> becauſe he <hi>fears</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43202:107"/> and <hi>hopes</hi> for nothing. He does the ſame things which other men doe, but not after the ſame manner; and therefore he hides his actions from the <hi>eyes</hi> of the common people, and does not willingly make himſelf familiar with them. He ſoon forgetteth
<hi>injuries,</hi> and is not ſubject to complain when forced to ſuffer any thing. He <hi>praiſeth</hi> few, nor does he deſire the <hi>praiſe</hi> of others, but ſtill labours to doe things worthy of <hi>praiſe.</hi> He cares not for pleaſing any but his friends and <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours:</hi> nor does he eaſily admire any thing becauſe nothing ever ſeems great or new unto him. He fears no <hi>diſaſtrous</hi> event, being ever ſecure in his own <hi>Vertue.</hi> He hath a ſlow <hi>gate,</hi> a grave <hi>voice,</hi> a moderate ſtaid <hi>ſpeech;</hi> for he that is not ſollicitous about many things, hath no need to make great haſt; amd he that is content within himſelf, needs not any great wrangling.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>PAtience</hi> is a Vertue, which makes us ſuffer all the <hi>miſeries</hi> of this life with a willing mind. But becauſe theſe <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are manifold, this <hi>vertue</hi> hath ſeverall names, according to the diverſity of <hi>Evils</hi> which we are wont to ſuffer. It is properly called <hi>Patience,</hi> when it beareth
<hi>injuries</hi> with an equal mind: it is called <hi>Equanimity</hi> when we ſuffer patiently the loſſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>goods:</hi> It is called
<hi>Longanimity</hi> when it fortifies the hart in the long expectation of ſome <hi>good:</hi> It is called <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> when it ſtrengthens the <hi>will</hi> to bear all other ſort of publick and private
<hi>miſeryes.</hi> There is no <hi>vertue,</hi> which we can have a more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſion to practiſe. For we are encompaſſed on all ſides with ſo many <hi>enemies</hi> and ſo many <hi>miſeries,</hi> that
<hi>Job</hi> had good reaſon to ſay, that the life of man is a

                  <hi>warfare</hi> upon earth. There is

                  </gap>rdly any <hi>moment</hi> of our life, wherein we have not occaſion to <hi>fight.</hi> And althô we had no outward <hi>enemies,</hi> yet every man is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>enemy</hi> to himſelf. The ſource and cauſe of all that troubles and torments us, is in ourſelves and from ourſelves. We begin our life with <hi>Tears,</hi> and we are fit for nothing elſe in our <hi>infancy.</hi> This is the firſt thing we learn, and we practiſe it ever after, untill <hi>death.</hi> We read of many that never <hi>laughed,</hi> but we have not one <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of any man that never <hi>wept.</hi> Patience therefore is neceſſary, to fortify our <hi>harts,</hi> to ſtrengthen our <hi>ſpirit,</hi> to compleat our
<hi>vertues.</hi> No man knows his own ſtrength and vertue, unles he hath ſuffered ſome <hi>croſſe</hi> or adverſity. And he that wanteth
<hi>patience,</hi> cannot be eſteemed a <hi>wiſe</hi> man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He cannot be <hi>happy,</hi> who hath never ſuffered ſome <hi>adverſity. Phiſitians</hi> tell us that too much <hi>health</hi> is a bad ſign, and conſequently to be feared and <hi>Mariners</hi> are ever afraid of the <hi>ſea</hi> in too great a <hi>calm.</hi> If thou art in ſome <hi>calamity</hi> or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, doe not think it intolerable, but remember it is a <hi>combat</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath ſent thee. Unles thou <hi>fighteſt,</hi> thou canſt not overcome; and unles thou overcomeſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43202:109"/> thou wilt never be crowned. And ſince
<hi>it was neceſſary that Chriſt should ſuffer, and ſoe to enter into his glory;</hi> dareſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or hope to be partaker of his
<hi>glory</hi> &amp; felicity without having ſuffered any thing? Thou art much miſtaken, if thou thinkeſt to find any other way to <hi>heaven.</hi> The two main principles of <hi>vertue</hi> are, to doe <hi>good,</hi> and ſuffer <hi>evill.</hi> It is a mark of true <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> when thou canſt quietly bear an <hi>injury</hi> from another, when thou canſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>miſery</hi> without murmuring againſt <hi>God,</hi> when thou canſt endure the company of thoſe who have done thee <hi>wrong,</hi> when thou canſt hear thyſelf <hi>calumniated</hi> without hating the perſon who does it, when thou ſubmitteſt thyſelf to the will of <hi>God</hi> in all thy <hi>ſufferances,</hi> when thou doſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto others of thy <hi>croſſes,</hi> when thou <hi>loueſt</hi> thoſe who <hi>hate</hi> thee: when thou makeſt thy complaints only unto <hi>God,</hi> and art ready to endure much more with joy and thanks-giving. Laſtly, he is truly
<hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> who doth not fall into impatience againſt the imperfections of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we ſuffer any loſſe in our
<hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi> affairs, we may ſoon comfort our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves if we conſider the inconſtancy of all <hi>wordly</hi> things. Whatſoever thou poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeſt,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43202:109"/> whatſover thou loueſt, naturally flyes away from thee: it is in thy cuſtody for a while, but is not properly thine. Doe not permit thyſelf to be deluded with the hopes of an imaginary ſtability in ſuch things. Being thyſelf <hi>infirm</hi> thou art not to expect any thing <hi>firm</hi> in this world, and of all things thou poſſeſſeſt, nothing will remain with thee to the end but
<hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> This is the only <hi>immortall</hi> thing which
<hi>mortall</hi> man can challenged: all things elſe are ſubject to
<hi>death.</hi> Therefore whatſoever thou poſſeſſeſt eſteem it ſoe, as ſtill to leave a great diſtance betwixt it and thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A
<hi>vertuous</hi> man can looſe nothing, becauſe he poſſeſſeth nothing as his own. Why doſt thou grieve for the loſſe of thy
<hi>mony,</hi> for the death of thy <hi>Children,</hi> and the burning of thy
<hi>houſe:</hi> and yet art not ſorry for the loſſe of thy modeſty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and other <hi>vertues?</hi> whereas theſe <hi>latter</hi> are in thy power, and thoſe <hi>firſt</hi> are neither thine, nor in thy power. If thou art ſorry for the <hi>loſſe</hi> of them, thou sheweſt thyſelf worthy to <hi>looſe</hi> them. Thou wouldſt eſteem thyſelf to have <hi>loſt</hi> nothing, if thou didſt love nothing with a diſordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. A <hi>wiſe</hi> man is never troubled for theſe exteriour things, becauſe they doe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43202:110"/> not touch nor concern him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Before thou goeſt about to doe any thing, conſider all the circumſtances that belong unto it, and thou wilt find many things which may give thee trouble, unles thou preventeſt them. Haſt thou occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to call a <hi>Servant?</hi> it may happen, that he is not
<hi>preſent,</hi> or does not doe what thou wouldſt have him doe? Art thou going to <hi>viſit</hi> any body? it may happen, that the <hi>party</hi> is at home but neglects thee and will not <hi>anſwer.</hi> Foreſee all theſe things, and all will be well. Such a one would not accept of my
<hi>company</hi> to day, having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted others: He would not hearken to my
<hi>diſcourſe:</hi> he placed me in the laſt place. Theſe are the ordinary complaints of <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile</hi> ſpirits, into which delicate, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and indiſcreet perſons are wont to fall. A <hi>wiſe</hi> man never takes notice of theſe things, becauſe he knows the life of man is ſubject to them. The beſt <hi>remedy</hi> is to ſuffer what thou canſt not mend. If thou art offended with the malice or impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of any one, conſider that tis in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner impoſſible the world should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome wicked or impudent people. And if this ſeems impoſſible, what wonder is it to ſee <hi>evill</hi> men doe <hi>evill?</hi> Take heed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43202:110"/> thou art not more to blame thyſelf, who didſt not foreſee that ſuch a perſon would offend thee in that kind. The <hi>world</hi> is ſtill like itſelf, and will never be without
<hi>ſin</hi> as long as <hi>men</hi> are in it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When thou ſuffereth any pain or greif, conſider not ſoe much what thou endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as what thou haſt done to deſerve it. And if thou wilt acknowledge the <hi>Truth,</hi> thou wilt confeſſe thou haſt deſerved far greater ſufferings. <hi>God</hi> is the author of all things. The <hi>end</hi> of his chaſtiſing thee is, that he may <hi>cure</hi> thee, that he may exerciſe thy <hi>vertue,</hi> that he may harden thee to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, &amp; prepare thee for himſelf. And thoſe Whom he ſeems to ſpare, he reſerves for <hi>future</hi> puniſhment. How shall I know what
<hi>vertue</hi> thou art armed with to ſuffer <hi>Poverty,</hi> if thou aboundeſt in <hi>Riches?</hi> how shall I know thy conſtancy againſt the
<hi>calumnies</hi> and hatred of thy <hi>enemies,</hi> if thou groweſt
<hi>old</hi> without over having had any? I have often heared thee
<hi>comfort</hi> others in affliction; but I should be more willing to hear thee <hi>comfort</hi> thyſelf, and ſee thee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate thy <hi>greif</hi> when any <hi>Croſſe</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee. If thou art wont to thank and reward the <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> that burns and cuts thy fleſh; why doſt thou not alſo yeild to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43202:111"/> that <hi>medicine</hi> which is ſent thee from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> It is a folly to eſteem that a
<hi>loſſe,</hi> which is rather a <hi>remedy.</hi> If poverty, ſicknes, and all thoſe other things, which thou calleſt <hi>evils,</hi> could ſpeak, they would inſult over thee, and tell thee: why, oh man, doſt thou think us thy <hi>enemies?</hi> Art thou deprived of any happines through our fault? What vertue have we taken away from thee? have we made thee looſe thy Prudence, Juſtice, or Fortitude? what hinders on our part but that thou maiſt ſtill be merry? That which thou eſteemeſt <hi>bad</hi> will turn to <hi>good,</hi> if thou ſtill keepeſt thy <hi>patience,</hi> and ſtandeſt firm againſt all <hi>events.</hi> It is a great <hi>evill</hi> not to be able to ſuffer <hi>evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Thou maiſt ſometimes diſſemble thy
<hi>conſtancy</hi> in the afflictions of <hi>others,</hi> but never in thy own. Let thy ſorrow and mourning be common with thoſe that mourn, but not the cauſe of it. Comply a little with thoſe who are <hi>afflicted;</hi> shew thyſelf concerned in their <hi>miſeries,</hi> that by this means thou maiſt be a <hi>comfort</hi> to them. No man can help another that is fallen to riſe, unles he bows himſelf to lend him his hand. But becauſe all things may be taken two wayes, whereof the one is tolerable,

               <p n="1">1. <hi>MIldnes</hi> is a vertue which breaketh the violence of <hi>Anger,</hi> and keeps us within the limits of patience.
<hi>Anger</hi> is a weapon, which thou maiſt lawfully uſe, when thou art obliged by thy <hi>office</hi> to correct and punish <hi>vice:</hi> and when pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dictates that thou art obliged to repell an <hi>injury</hi> from thyſelf or thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, leaſt that the <hi>wicked</hi> take occaſion from thy unreaſonable <hi>patience</hi> to encreaſe their <hi>malice.</hi> There is as much <hi>cruelty,</hi> in forgiving all, as in forgiving no man.

<hi>Criminels,</hi> be not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of <hi>mildnes</hi> and
<hi>Clemency.</hi> When thou punisheſt the guilty, doe it as if thou wert forced to it againſt thy will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; and carry thyſelf towards thoſe who offend the <hi>Laws,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> beareth with thee. As he beareth with thee, in hope of making thee better: ſoe thou oughteſt to bear ſometimes with others, that they may
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43202:115"/> grow better. Thou haſt no confidence in the <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> when thou deſpaireſt of the <hi>ſick</hi> mans recovery. But we ought to have more hope of his recovery, by how much the
<hi>Phiſitian</hi> is more skillfull and obliging. A man that is
<hi>mild</hi> appears as a <hi>Rock</hi> above all the waves and ſtorms of
<hi>Anger;</hi> and breaks all the force of the <hi>Tempeſt.</hi> He is more contented to ſee the <hi>ſinner</hi> repent, then punished. Our <hi>B.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>mildnes</hi> is a vertue that moderates
<hi>Anger,</hi> ſo <hi>clemency</hi> is a vertue which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates the ſeverity of <hi>punishment.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> belongs unto all men, the <hi>ſecond</hi> unto <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> only and <hi>Superiours.</hi> The nature and property of it is to inflict a leſſer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the
<hi>Laws</hi> require; not out of fear, intereſt, friendſhip, or other motive, but through a pure motive of <hi>mildnes.</hi> He that

               <p n="1">1. <hi>MOdeſty</hi> is a geat ornament to all other
<hi>vertues</hi> and good qualities. It is the true <hi>form</hi> of honeſty, and <hi>bridle</hi> of vice. Although thou ſpeakeſt nothing, yet thy habit and geſtures shew what thou art. We may judge of <hi>vertue</hi> by ſmall ſigns. We often ſee what a man is by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, laughing, gate, and turning of his eyes. Live ſoe, that all may know thou belongeſt to the ſociety of <hi>Angels.</hi> Obſerve a conſtant <hi>decorum</hi> in all the motions of thy <hi>body,</hi> in all thy geſtures, ſpeech, and looks; that thou maiſt not ſeem rude or effeminate in any thing. True
<hi>modeſty</hi> doth not only reſide in the <hi>mind,</hi> but appears alſo in an outward gravity of the <hi>body,</hi> as if the <hi>ſoul</hi> took pleaſure in ſeeing the <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> conform itſelf to the
<hi>interiour.</hi> A <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt</hi> man is a living <hi>picture</hi> of the <hi>Deity:</hi> for his only ſight is enough to ſtrike gravity into thoſe who behold him. And who can expreſſe what an excellent thing it is, to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43202:117"/> doe good unto our neighbours by being ſeen only? It belongs alſo unto <hi>modeſty,</hi> not to exceed thy ſtate and condition, in thy cloaths, houſehold-ſtuffe, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of
<hi>Servants.</hi> Theſe are impediments of thy mind, which doe not adorn thee, but the things that are without thee. Why therefore doſt thou rejoyce in thy unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines? Why doſt thou admire vain things, and makeſt glory in things which doe thee more hurt then good. This great Trayn of
<hi>ſervants</hi> which are alwaies about thee, may be rather called a troop of <hi>Enemies,</hi> whom thou canſt never fear enough. They are ſtill more ready to obſerve what thou <hi>doſt</hi> then to hear what thou
<hi>commandeſt.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more humble then their entrance into thy
<hi>ſervice,</hi> nothing more inſolent then their progreſſe or comportment in it, and nothing more full of <hi>hatred</hi> then their going from thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Studioſity</hi> hath two properties: the
<hi>one</hi> is to know how to govern and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the deſire of knowing, which moſt commonly is greater then it should be: the <hi>other</hi> is, to shake of all <hi>idlenes,</hi> and to ſtir up out induſtry to learn thoſe things which are neceſſary. Nature hath given man a <hi>wit</hi> naturally enclined to <hi>Curioſity;</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:43202:117"/> and conſcious of her own beauty &amp; skill, hath made us <hi>ſpectatours</hi> of all her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>works;</hi> and would eſteem all her <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> loſt, if ſo many great, and excellent things lay hid, and were ſeen by none but herſelf. But we abuſe the goodnes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſearching with too much curioſity into thoſe things, which were better unknown. He is not to be counted <hi>wiſe</hi> or learned, who knows much, but who knows what is to the purpoſe. We should firſt learn thoſe things which concern our
<hi>Salvation.</hi> But I doe not diſſuade thee from <hi>reading</hi> other things, provided thou refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt all things to good manners and to make thyſelf better. Take heed that too much <hi>reading</hi> of too many
<hi>books</hi> doth not diſcover a fickle unconſtant ſpirit. Thou muſt fixe thy ſtudy upon a certain number of good and choyce <hi>books,</hi> if thou deſireſt to learn any thing that may remain in thy mind. There is more
<hi>pleaſure</hi> in reading ſeverall ſorts of <hi>books,</hi> but more
<hi>profit</hi> in reading few choyce ones.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary to let our <hi>mind</hi> reſt ſometimes, and to recreate it after much labour; for no <hi>ſtudy</hi> can laſt long without ſome intermiſſion. The antient <hi>Law-givers</hi> deſigned certain dayes, wherein the <hi>people</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:43202:118"/> might meet together to be merry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create their ſpirits. There are ſeverall ſorts of <hi>actions</hi> which may divert and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the <hi>mind.</hi> As for example, to
<hi>walk</hi> in ſome open and pleaſant place, where the <hi>mind</hi> may be free to contemplate, and the <hi>body</hi> grow more vigorous with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying freſh <hi>ayr:</hi> to goe and paſſe ſome time in the countrey, free from all the tumults of the City: Thou maiſt alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thyſelf in hawking, hunting, fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like innocent <hi>recreations,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they are not misbecoming thy ſtate and condition: thou maiſt likewiſe apply thyſelf to ſome mild and recreative <hi>Study,</hi> hear or play upon ſome <hi>Muſicall</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; uſe ſome innocent
<hi>play;</hi> converſe merrily and jeaſt with thy <hi>friends;</hi> but with this caution, that thou doſt not ſpeak any injurious or undecent
<hi>words.</hi> Some men are too ſevere in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and as if they hated all <hi>ſociety,</hi> are too much addicted to their
<hi>ſolitude,</hi> and can never be brought to ſpeak a merry <hi>word.</hi> Others are alwaies in a <hi>jeſting</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and can never apply themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to any thing, never uſe any retreat. But theſe things are to be taken alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: for <hi>ſolitude</hi> will make thee deſire
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43202:118"/> the <hi>converſation</hi> of others, and too much <hi>company</hi> will make thee deſire <hi>ſolitude:</hi> &amp; thus the one will ſtill be a <hi>remedy</hi> to the other. Beſides, a little <hi>Remiſsion</hi> ſometimes will take away the unwillingnes of taking pains, and a little <hi>labour</hi> will take away the tediouſnes of
<hi>Remiſsion.</hi> There are ſome again who not underſtanding how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe their own forces, have no modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their <hi>actions,</hi> but weary themſelves with too much <hi>labour.</hi> They neither know how to leave of their <hi>ſtudies</hi> when once begun, nor how to ſettle themſelves again to them, when once intermitted. When they have once begun to doe a thing, they follow it <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night,</hi> and never leave of untill they find their ſtrength fayl with too much application. And on the other ſide when they begin to take their <hi>recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they are ſoe addicted unto it, that they cannot be eaſily brought again to apply themſelves to any <hi>ſerious</hi> buſines. Wherefore we muſt endeavor only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create and divert our mind for a while &amp; not to diſtract it too much with unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>diſſolutions.</hi> To perform this we have need of that <hi>vertue</hi> which is called <hi>Eutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelia;</hi> which turns all things to the beſt, and preſcribeth certain bounds unto all
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43202:119"/> things, which we muſt never paſſe. The <hi>beſt</hi> things become <hi>bad,</hi> when a man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth no meaſure or <hi>rule</hi> in them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. ALL <hi>Humility</hi> cometh from our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Tis he who hath preached it in <hi>words,</hi> and taught it by his own <hi>Example.</hi> Next unto the <hi>Theologicall</hi> and
<hi>Intellectuall Vertues, Humility</hi> holdeth the firſt place; becauſe it is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to <hi>Pride,</hi> which is the ſource of all
<hi>evill.</hi> This is the <hi>vertue</hi> which makes us agreeable unto
<hi>God,</hi> becauſe he converſeth interiourly with thoſe who are
<hi>humble</hi> of hart. Without this, which is the Ground and foundation of all other <hi>vertues,</hi> all our ſpirituall <hi>building</hi> will be but weak and unſtable. And although in its <hi>name</hi> it ſeems to carry ſomething of low and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet it is the <hi>vertue</hi> of
<hi>great</hi> perſons, becauſe it is the <hi>vertue</hi> of the
<hi>perfect,</hi> and elevates the mind to higher things. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43202:119"/> 
                  <hi>great</hi> things without all danger of <hi>pride</hi> or vain glory, without fear of the difficulty; and ſtill beareth up with the ſame tenour, conſtancy, and tranquillity againſt all
<hi>hazards. Humility</hi> doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as the common ſort of people falſly thinks, in having an abject and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible opinion of ourſelves; but in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moderate deſire of honour and glory, which hath neither any exceſſe nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The <hi>humble</hi> man deſireth glory as the reward of <hi>vertue,</hi> regarding the <hi>action</hi> itſelf, not for any <hi>vain</hi> glory, but <hi>vertue</hi> alone. All <hi>honour</hi> is illegitimate, which it not got by <hi>vertue.</hi> But whereas he that is
<hi>humble</hi> underſtands himſelf well, and judgeth aright of himſelf, he therefore juſtly refuſeth as much as he can all <hi>honour;</hi> as well becauſe he knows he contributes very little to his own <hi>vertues;</hi> as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he fears, leaſt that by conſenting to the
<hi>honours</hi> which are due unto him, he should by degrees be tempted to deſire thoſe which are not due. It is more ſafe ſtill, to contemn all
<hi>honours;</hi> for he who refuſes them, augmenteth them; and he who contemns them, encreaſes his own glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon why thou art not <hi>humble</hi> is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43202:120"/> becauſe thou doſt not know thyſelf. There is no countrey ſoe remote, of which thou wilt not ſooner believe a hundred falſe <hi>ſtories,</hi> then of thyſelf. What is man? A frayl
<hi>body;</hi> without all defence of its own nature, needing the help of others, and expoſed to all the rigours and injuries of <hi>Time:</hi> a heap of clay, an unclean animal, inclined to all <hi>evill,</hi> and of ſo perverſe &amp; depraved a nature, that he preferreth <hi>earth</hi> to

But no man can be truly <hi>perfect</hi> without the ſpeciall <hi>grace</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi> And becauſe few diſpoſe their <hi>Souls</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this interiour help of <hi>God,</hi> this is the reaſon that few arrive unto
